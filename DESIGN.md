# DESIGN.md — amix-z3660rtg: the ZZ9000 Amix driver as a Z3660 RTG driver

> **Out-of-repo citations.** Run artefacts (reports, transcripts, frames) are cited by file name. They, sibling repositories and archived images are kept outside this repo and are not needed to build or use the driver.

**Status: AGREED 2026-09-15 (decisions in §9). Implemented on branch `z3660-target` (d5671a7 table/accessor/probe with the default rows; 9adfdcd the Z3660 and bench rows); bench step 0 pending (docs/BENCH-STEP0.md).** *(Status line of 2026-09-15.)*

> **Status (2026-09-26).** Initial working version, **metal-proven end to end**: the candidate-2 kernel (driver 7e5c0e8) + the cross-built `Xzz9000` brought the OpenLook desktop up on the Z3660 HDMI from a real A4000 (metal session 2, rows 0–7, `docs/DEMO-RTG.md`; status of record 2026-09-19). Performance is poor; it is the next lane. Whether ZZ9000 and Z3660 stay one driver is still open.

Author: the amix-z3660rtg driver side. Citations are `file:line` against upstream 75e2449 (this
repo), the Z3660 firmware tree (`Z3660/z3660-firmware/Z-TURN/vitis_ide/`, abbreviated
`FW/`), the Z3660 AmigaOS drivers (`Z3660/z3660-drivers/`, abbreviated `DRV/`), the
amiberry fork (github.com/jusii/amiberry, branch `amix-v830`, not yet public), the sibling drivers and the grimoire. Confidence: ✅ read in
source / measured, 🟡 secondary document, ❓ open (listed in §5 and §10).

The document answers: (1) what in the upstream driver is *identity/window* knowledge versus
*register protocol*; (2) what the Z3660 RTG actually looks like from the guest; (3) the single
switch that separates the targets and exactly what it changes; (4) what only the Z3660
firmware side's `FIRMWARE-RTG-INTERFACE.md` (or metal) can still close; (5) bench and compiler
constraints; (6) the project decisions it needs.

## 0. Summary — including one correction to the starting premise

- **The premise "register interface is ZZ9000-compatible" is true at the protocol
  level and false at the byte level.** The Z3660 firmware keeps the ZZ9000's register *names,
  order and semantics* (MODE = `id | color<<8 | scale<<12`, the blitter registers, PAN as a
  byte offset, the same colour modes) but exposes them as a **32-bit-word register file
  starting at `0x100`** (`FW/Z3660/src/rtg/zzregs.h:28-78`; `DRV/rtg/gfx.c:211-212,485`
  `registers[(reg)>>2]`), not the ZZ9000's 16-bit registers at `0x00..0xc0` that upstream
  (`zz9000.h:19-50`) and amiberry (`src/zz9000.cpp:44-89`) speak. There is no `HW_VERSION`,
  `FW_VERSION` moved to `0x1A0` and reads `0x0103`, `PAN_HI/LO` became one register at
  `0x120`, the capture switch is a stub, the framebuffer starts at **`+0x200000`**, and mode
  id 17 is **1280x800**, not 1920x800 (`zz_video_modes.h:21`). Pointed at `0x10000000`,
  upstream's driver would read `0xffff/0xffff` and declare the board absent.
- The rest of the starting facts hold: with `autoconfig_rtg NO` (every Amix preset) the
  RTG/ethernet/piscsi combo window is hard-mapped at guest `0x10000000` with no AutoConfig
  entry (`FW/Z3660_emu/src/cpu_emulator.cpp:221-236`), inside the kernel's identity-mapped
  low 1 GB, so it is reached the way the sibling drivers reach it: AGA-gated fixed-base probe,
  signature read, plain dereference, no `sptalloc`.
- **Proposed switch: one board-table row per target, rows compiled in by a single
  `-DZZ9K_TARGET_Z3660`.** A row carries identity (autocon code or fixed base + gate),
  window (register block, framebuffer offset/size), the register map + access width, the
  mode table, presence test and capture semantics. All upstream sites that today read a
  `ZZ9K_*` macro read `bp->bt->…` instead; the default build's rows reproduce upstream's
  behaviour exactly (bench step 0 proves it). The delta is larger than an identity swap
  because the register file differs, but it is still data plus one probe function plus a
  ~30-line register accessor — no `#ifdef` inside any function.
- Unchanged: `/dev/zz9000`, char major 49, the ioctl ABI, `zz9k_test`'s flow, the
  `Xzz9000` server (it mmaps `board_size` and takes `base + fb_offset`; it never assumes
  `0x10000` or 4 MB — `x11r6.3-amix/…/rtg/zz9000/zz9000hw.c:114-136`).
- Two kernels, two compilers: bench = golden 68030 build, GNU GCC 1.40.5, 2 KiB pages;
  metal = 68LC060 Model-B kernel from `amix-040-060-port`, cross gcc 2.7.2.3, **4 KiB
  pages**. The one trap is `phystopfn()` in `zz9000mmap` (§7).

## 1. What we start from (bench-proven)

Bench run of 2026-09-15 on the amix-kerntools ZZ9000 rig (09d4b6f + 00c316c; `11-report.md`,
`31-report-resume.md`). ✅

| Fact | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Upstream 75e2449 compiles with the golden's **GNU GCC 1.40.5** once the Makefile's gcc-2 `-fno-builtin` is stripped; the C needs no change (zero diagnostics for `zz9000.c`, `zz9k_test.c`, `colorls.c`) | `04-build-zz9000.log`, `05-/06-gcc1405-*`, kerntools `chardevs.conf` `cflags_strip=-fno-builtin` |
| Kernel 09684 boots in the piscsi rig; `autocon match pc 0x6D6E0003 base 0x200000 size 0x400000` / `Zorro II board … hw 0x0 fw 0x207` | `19-rig-boot-zz9000-kernel.png` |
| `zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 1920x800`: `fb 0x10000+0x3d0000`, `MODE readback 0x0111`, bars on the emulated card | `22-zz9k_test-1920x800.txt`, `25-rtg-1920x800-16-bars.png` (pattern checked by eye here) |
| The driver's own framebuffer console at 1920x800, sunfont, scroll + cursor | `27-rtg-console-b.png` |
| `bootinfo.autocon[]` on the rig: `[0]` 0xc7 Z2 0x6d6e/3 at 0x200000 4 MB; `[1]` A2065; `[2]` 0x83 Z3 **0x144b/1 at 0x40000000 128 MB** (amiberry's piscsi model) | `09-amix-bootinfo-autocon.txt` |
| amiberry bug, not a driver bug: `zz_set_pan` takes the pitch from blitter X2 on every PAN_LO write (`src/zz9000.cpp:965-975,1364-1370`); the driver's SWITCH_RTG writes PAN=0 with X2==0 → black. No fix in the fork's log yet | `24-…pitch0.png`, `zzpanfix.c` |
| Kernel wiring via kerntools `chardevs.conf` (sha-pinned subtree push, on-box `ed` of `init_tbl[]`/`cdevsw[49]`/driver Makefile); `c1.c` console hook OFF | `chardevs.work.conf:33` |

The chardevs record points at a clone of isoriano's repository; the
bench of *this* fork needs it repointed to `amix-z3660rtg/overlay/…` with a new sha pin
(cross-repo note, §6).

## 2. Inventory: identity/window knowledge vs register protocol in upstream

### 2.1 `zz9000.h`

| Constant | Value | Class | Z3660 verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ZZ9K_MNT_MANUFACTURER`, `ZZ9K_PRODUCT_Z2/_Z3`, `ZZ9K_PRODUCT`, `ZZ9K_PRODUCT_PC_Z2/_Z3` (`:11-16`) | 0x6d6e, 3, 4, packed `(mfg<<16)\|prod` | **identity** | Z3660 mfg is 0x144B; the RTG has no AutoConfig identity of its own under `autoconfig_rtg NO` |
| `ZZ9K_MAX_AUTOCON` (`:17`) | 16 | kernel | neutral |
| `ZZ9K_REG_*` (`:19-50`) | 16-bit at 0x00…0x5e, 0xc0, 0x1000…0x1006 | **protocol, ZZ9000 byte layout** | **differs**: 32-bit at 0x100… (§3.3) |
| `ZZ9K_REG_SIZE` (`:52`) | 0x2000 | window | still right: Z3660 registers end below 0x900, `0x1000-0x1FFF` is a firmware test area, piscsi starts at 0x2000 — the bound keeps GETREG/SETREG off the SCSI mailbox |
| `ZZ9K_FB_OFFSET` (`:53`) | 0x10000 | **window** | **0x200000** on the Z3660 |
| `ZZ9K_Z2_RESERVED_TAIL` (`:54`) | 0x20000 | **window** | none; instead an upper bound at +0x3000000 (§3.2) |
| `ZZ9K_FW_VER_MIN` (`:55`) | 0x010d | **identity** | Z3660 FW_VERSION = 0x0103 in another numbering |
| `ZZ9K_COLOR_*` (`:57-60`) | 0-3 | protocol | same (15-bit is remapped to 565 by the firmware) |
| `ZZ9K_MODE_*` (`:62-81`) | ids 0-17 | protocol, **table differs from 12 up** | §3.4 |
| `ZZ9K_SWITCH_*`, `ZZ9K_CAPTURE_PAN[_VGA]` (`:83-87`) | | ZZ9000 capture concept | no capture path on the Z3660 (§3.5) |
| `ZZ9K_IOC*`, `ZZ9K_CONSOLE_*`, `struct zz9k_*` (`:89-197`) | | **ABI** | bit-identical, both targets |

### 2.2 `zz9000.c`

| Site | Class | Assumes |
|---|---|---|
| header comment (`:1-8`) "AMIX has no Zorro III support" | doc | imprecise: `autocon()` returns Zorro III bases; the wall is the identity map above `0x3FFFFFFF` (grimoire `zorro-autoconfig.md:52-64`) |
| `struct zz9k_board` (`:87-98`) | window | no per-board `fb_offset`, register map, mode table |
| `ZZ9K_REG()` macro (`:24-25`) and its ~40 uses | **protocol, 16-bit** | every register access is a 16-bit volatile at a ZZ9000 offset |
| `zz9k_present()` (`:260-274`) | presence rule | HW@0x00 and FW@0xc0 not both 0/0xffff — on the Z3660 both offsets are unmapped → "absent" |
| `zz9k_attach()` (`:277-309`) | window + identity | `fb_size = size - FB_OFFSET - Z2_TAIL`; "Zorro II board"; `FW_VER_MIN` |
| `zz9k_probe()` (`:331-362`) | **identity** | `autocon(PC_Z2)` → attach; `autocon(PC_Z3)` → reject; runs from `zz9000init()` and lazily from rw/mmap/ioctl |
| `zz9k_mode_id()` (`:160-179`) | protocol, **table** | width/height → ZZ9000 id; 1920x800 → 17 |
| `zz9k_fill_fbinfo()` (`:198-258`) | ABI | `fb_offset = ZZ9K_FB_OFFSET` (`:203`) |
| `zz9k_write32` (`:364-372`), `zz9k_set_mode_hw` (`:484-507`), `zz9k_set_switch_hw` (`:509-521`) | protocol | HI/LO split writes; zeroes X1/Y1/X2/Y2/COLORMODE/SRC/DST/SPLIT_POS, PAN=0, then MODE; switch = CX_CAPTURE + PAN |
| `zz9k_blit_fill/copy` (`:374-416`) | protocol, **dead code** | never called |
| CPU fill/copy (`:418-482`), FILL ioctl (`:1348-1363`) | window | `base + ZZ9K_FB_OFFSET` at `:431,:454,:1360` |
| console renderer (`:523-1140`) | window + geometry | `ZZ9K_FB_OFFSET` at `:645,:658,:696,:736`; fixed 1920x800 / mode 17 / RGB565 (`:147-150`) |
| `zz9000rw()` (`:1179-1210`) | window | `uiomove` from the kernel VA `bp->base` over `[0, board_size)` — needs the identity map |
| `zz9000mmap()` (`:1230-1247`) | window + **page geometry** | `phystopfn(base + offset)` over `[0, board_size)` |
| `ZZ9KIOC_GETINFO` (`:1297-1312`) | identity | `product = 3`, `zorro = 2`, `fb_offset = ZZ9K_FB_OFFSET` |
| GETREG/SETREG (`:1404-1420`) | protocol | raw 16-bit at `offset < 0x2000` |

### 2.3 `tools/zz9k_test.c`

`print_z2_expected()` (`:21-33`, macros, cosmetic); `print_autocon()` + the gate `:312-321` that
**exits unless an autocon entry 0x6d6e/3 exists** — blocks every test on a hard-mapped Z3660;
`print_regs()` (`:140-168`) reads HW/FW/MODE/CONFIG/VCAP by raw ZZ9000 offsets; `mmap(0,
info.board_size)` (`:516`) — maps whatever the driver reports; the messages at `:315,:326-327`.

### 2.4 Target-neutral

`integration/*.txt` (init_tbl, cdevsw 49, `displayedscreen` hook), `mkdev.sh`, `init/S99zz9000`,
`tools/zz9k_console`, `zz9k_colorls_env`, `colorls.c`, `install-source.sh`; the Makefile apart
from `-fno-builtin` (gcc-2 only) and the optional target define.

### 2.5 Pure protocol shared by both targets

MODE/colour/scale encoding, PAN as a framebuffer byte offset, the "X2 doubles as pitch, 0 =
native width" convention (`FW/Z3660/src/video.c:809-812`; amiberry gets this wrong), `zz9k_bpp`,
`fbinfo` masks, the console's ANSI state machine, every ioctl's semantics and struct layout,
the X server contract (`PROBE → SETMODE → GETINFO/GETFBINFO → mmap(board_size) → FILL →
SETSWITCH RTG`; close `SETSWITCH CAPTURE` + `munmap`).

## 3. The Z3660 RTG as the guest sees it

From the firmware and AmigaOS-driver sources, confirmed by the Z3660 firmware side's answer sheet
(`docs/FIRMWARE-RTG-INTERFACE.md`, merged 2026-09-15; verbatim answers in
`docs/FIRMWARE-ANSWERS-2026-09-15.md`) — nothing in this section is contradicted by it. The demo machine runs the **real 68LC060**
(`bootmode CPU`), so the bus path that matters is the FPGA→ARM handler `rtg_thread()`
(`FW/Z3660/src/rtg/rtg.c:552-720`), not the on-ARM UAE addrbanks used by the emulated-CPU
modes; both dispatch into the same `read_rtg_register()`/`write_rtg_register()`.

### 3.1 Identity and placement

| | `autoconfig_rtg NO` (shipped default, every Amix preset) | `autoconfig_rtg YES` |
|---|---|---|
| Base | **`0x10000000`**, hard-mapped by `reset_autoconfig()`, `configured_z3 \|= 2` so it never enters the guest's AutoConfig walk (`cpu_emulator.cpp:221-236`; `amix_ram.h:52-75`) ✅ | a Zorro III board: `er_type 0x83/0x93` (emulated path, `cpu_emulator.cpp:325-336`) / `0x8B/0x9B` (FPGA path, `z3660.v:973`), both 128 MB; **product `0x01`** (`cpu_emulator.cpp:338-345` "1 for the RTG PIC", `z3660.v:981`); manufacturer **0x144B** (`cpu_emulator.cpp:263`, `z3660.v:993-996`; `docs/real-cpu-autoconfig-and-ext-rom.md:96-102`) ✅ — i.e. `0x144B0001`, the code the siblings and amiberry use; lands at `0x40000000`, or `0x50000000` when the 256 MB RAM board autoconfigures first (🟡 `docs/amix-firmware-facts.md` §5) |
| `bootinfo.autocon[]` entry | none ✅ | Amix 2.1's table is documented to miss it anyway (grimoire `z3660-scsi-driver.md:194-201`) 🟡 |
| Kernel reachability | inside the identity-mapped low 1 GB → plain dereference, `phystokv(p) == p` (`amix-z3660scsi/src/z3660.c:640-651,711-745`) ✅ | above `VSECT1 = 0x40000000` → `sptalloc()` per page; the pool is 4 MB (`z3660.c:664-669`) |
| 060 data cache | `DTT0 = 0x003fc060` cache-inhibits the whole low 1 GB (`z3660.c:688-709`) ✅ | unverified: a kernel `sptalloc` mapping's cache class was never measured (the port's r13 note covers user device mmaps, which are NCS); unsupported by the siblings with a live cache |
| Sibling-driver product code | `Z3660_PROD 0x144B0001` = "Z3 RTG + piscsi combo" (`z3660.c:77`, `z3660eth.h:15`), consistent with the ROM bytes above and with amiberry's model (`src/z3660_scsi.cpp:49-51`) ✅ | |

**v1 supports the NO configuration only**; the YES row is recognised and refused with advice,
the way upstream refuses product 4.

### 3.2 The 128 MB window at `0x10000000` (offsets relative to base)

`init_rtg_bank(0x100)`: `RANGE_MAP(0x1000,0x1020, rtg_regs_bank)` + `RANGE_MAP(0x1020,0x1800,
rtg_bank)` in 64 KB banks (`FW/Z3660_emu/src/uae/uae_emulator.cpp:1019-1024`) = a **2 MB
ARM-handled region** then **126 MB of RTG RAM**; the real-CPU handler masks `gpio & 0x1FFFFF`
(`rtg.c:570-571,644`) — the same 2 MB. ✅

| Offset | What | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `0x000000-0x000FFF` | RTG register file (registers at `0x100-0x89C`, the last being the ADF-name text block `0x800..0x895`, `rtg.c:787-795`; `0x000-0x0FF` and `0x8A0-0xFFF` unmapped, reads `0xFFFFFFFF`, writes ignored `rtg.c:2417-2420`) | this driver |
| `0x001000-0x001FFF` | firmware **"test area"**: raw memory + an **unconditional** `printf` on the ARM UART per access (not gated by `debug_console`), checked before the register range on both paths (`rtg.c:573-577,646-673`) — where upstream's `CX_*` writes would land; a userland loop over the page blocks the RTG thread on UART writes | nobody; **excluded from the row's device space** (§4.4) |
| `0x002000-0x005FFF` | piscsi mailbox (`0x2400-0x25FF` floppy) (`rtg.c:584-590,687-694`) | amix-z3660scsi |
| `0x006000-0x025FFF` | SCSI boot ROM (`memorymap.h:37-38`) | firmware |
| `0x080000-0x08FFFF` | piscsi bounce buffer (`SCSI_NO_DMA_ADDRESS`, `memorymap.h:36`; `z3660.c:80-81`) | amix-z3660scsi |
| **`0x200000`** | **framebuffer start** (`FRAMEBUFFER_ADDRESS = RTG_BASE+0x200000`, `memorymap.h:18`; `DRV/rtg/gfx.c:124,504` `Z3660_MEMBASE_ADDR`) ✅ | this driver |
| `0x200000-0x2FFFFFF` | RTG memory the AmigaOS driver claims: `MemorySize = 0x3000000 - 0x200000` = 46 MB (`gfx.c:511`) ✅ | this driver |
| `0x3200000` / `0x3210000` | GFXData scratch / templates for the DMA-op path (`memorymap.h:21`; `gfx.c:125-126`) | AmigaOS driver's DMA ops — unused by us |
| `0x4200000…` | soft3D buffers (`memorymap.h:24-25`) | |
| `0x7CE0000`, `0x7D00000` | audio TX/RX buffers | |
| `0x7E00000-0x7EFFFFF` | ethernet BD lists, RX backlog `0x7ED0000`, TX frame `0x7EE0000`, RX frame `0x7EF0000` — spelled as ARM-side absolute addresses in `memorymap.h:30-34`, bound board-relative by the net driver (`z3660eth.h:36-45`); the ARM MMU reserves RTG-relative MB `0x60-0x80` (top 32 MB) for overlay/audio/mpeg/eth (`cpu_emulator.cpp:432-459`) | amix-z3660net |
| `0x7F00000` | USB data | |

The `memorymap.h:43-50` comments (`//#define MNT_REG_BASE 0`, `//#define MNT_FB_BASE 0x10000`)
show the ZZ9000 layout was deliberately replaced.

### 3.3 Register compatibility table (registers upstream touches, plus the notable absentees)

ZZ9000 column = upstream `zz9000.h` and amiberry `src/zz9000.cpp:44-89` (16-bit, board+off).
Z3660 column = `FW/Z3660/src/rtg/zzregs.h` and `rtg.c` (32-bit, board+off, **aligned 32-bit
access only**: on the real-CPU path `rtg_thread()` re-reads the word at the raw address after
the FPGA lands the bus write in DDR (`rtg.c:570-580`), ignores the size bits on the register
path (they are honoured only for piscsi, `:596-610`), and `write_rtg_register()` aligns with
`zaddr & 0x1FFFFC` (`:1039-1042`) — so a 16-bit write at `0x100` is dispatched as
`V<<16 | stale(0x102)`, one at `0x102` as `V<<16 | stale(0x104)` to the `0x100` handler: a
HI/LO pair never composes. Reads: a 16-bit read gets one lane of the 32-bit value
(`:676-683`) — `FW_VERSION` read as a word at `0x1A0` is `0x0000`, at `0x1A2` `0x0103`.
**MODE, COLORMODE, X1/Y1/X2/Y2, ROW_PITCH and VBLANK_STATUS are write-only** on the Z3660
(`read_rtg_register` has no case for them; VBLANK's is commented out `:840-841`) → reads
 return `0xFFFFFFFF`, so `zz9k_test`'s "MODE readback" line cannot reproduce there. A MODE
write whose (mode, colour, scale) triple equals the cached one is a no-op (`:1120-1123`).
Handler line numbers are in `rtg.c` unless noted.

| Logical register | ZZ9000 | Z3660 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| HW_VERSION | `0x00` r16 (amiberry: 0) | **none** — `0x000-0x0FF` unmapped, read → `0xFFFFFFFF` (`:1023-1027`) | absent; presence test must change |
| MODE | `0x02` w16 `id\|color<<8\|scale<<12` | `0x100` w32, same formula (`:1111-1132`) | same semantics |
| CONFIG | `0x04` | `0x104` = eth/audio/usb interrupt enable/ack (`:1087-1110`) | never written by us ✓ (the net driver owns it) |
| SPRITE_X/Y | `0x06/0x08` | `0x108/0x10C` | unused |
| PAN | `0x0a` HI + `0x0c` LO | **`0x120` single w32**; firmware adds `(X1<<cm) + Y1*(X2<<cm)` and snapshots `pan_width = X2` (`:1055-1066`) | merged; keep X1=Y1=0 (upstream does) |
| VCAP_MODE | `0x0e` | none | unused by the driver; `zz9k_test` `print_regs` reads it (cosmetic) |
| BLITTER X1/Y1/X2/Y2 | `0x10/12/14/16` | `0x110/114/118/11C` | same order |
| ROW_PITCH | `0x18` | `0x124` | |
| X3/Y3 | `0x1a/0x1c` | `0x128/0x12C` | |
| RGB | `0x1e` HI + `0x20` LO | `0x130` w32, byte-swapped by the firmware (`:1214 rect_rgb = swap32(zdata)`) | merged; only matters if the dead blitter paths are revived |
| OP_FILLRECT / OP_COPYRECT | `0x22/0x24` | `0x134/0x138`, implemented (`:1239-1284`) | dead code in the driver |
| SRC / DST | `0x28/2a`, `0x2c/2e` | `0x140`, `0x144` w32 | merged |
| COLORMODE | `0x30` | `0x148` (15-bit → 565 remap `:1083-1085`) | |
| SRC_PITCH | `0x32` | `0x14C` | |
| VBLANK_STATUS | `0x4c` | `0x17C` | unused |
| SPLIT_POS | `0x5e` | `0x188` (`SET_SPLIT_POS`) | written 0 in `set_mode_hw` |
| FW_VERSION | `0xc0` r16; amiberry `0x0207`; upstream floor `0x010d` | `0x1A0` r32 = `(REVISION_MAJOR<<8)\|REVISION_MINOR` = **0x0103** (`:805-807`, `version.h:1-2`); `FW_BETA 0x280` = 21, `FW_ALFA 0x284` | different numbering; the row's floor is 0x0103 |
| CX_DATA_HI/LO, CX_OP | `0x1000-0x1004` (amiberry: palette latches) | firmware **test area** (§3.2); the palette equivalents are `REG_ZZ_OP_DATA 0x300` / `REG_ZZ_OP 0x304` (`:1887-1901`) | never written by us; 8-bit CLUT is unsupported on both targets (the driver sets no palette) |
| CX_CAPTURE | `0x1006` (capture ↔ RTG) | none; `REG_ZZ_OP_CAPTUREMODE 0x30C` is a **stub** (`:1905-1908`, `zz_set_monswitch` commented out); the AmigaOS driver still writes it (`DRV/rtg/gfx.c:1643-1669`) | the switch is a no-op on the Z3660 |
| BLITTER_DMA_OP / GFXData path | none in upstream | `0x180` + scratch at `+0x3200000` — how the AmigaOS driver pans/blits on Zorro III (`gfx.c:1683-1698`) | not needed: the direct `REG_ZZ_PAN` handler exists |
| Register block bound | `0x2000` | registers end at `0x89C`; `0x2000+` is piscsi | keep `0x2000` |
| Read of an unmapped register | (amiberry: 0) | `0xFFFFFFFF` (`:1023-1026`) | |
| Presence test precedent | upstream: HW/FW not both 0/0xffff | the AmigaOS driver accepts the board iff `FW_VERSION >> 8 == 1` (`DRV/rtg/gfx.c:488-495`) | the Z3660 row's `zz9k_present()` follows the AmigaOS driver |

### 3.4 Modes and colour

`REG_ZZ_MODE` accepts `id < ZZVMODE_NUM` (`:1114-1115`). Ids (`zz_video_modes.h:3-27`) vs
upstream (`zz9000.h:62-81`) and amiberry (`zz9000.cpp:387-406`):

| id | ZZ9000 (upstream/amiberry) | Z3660 |
|---|---|---|
| 0-11 | 1280x720, 800x600, 640x480, 1024x768, 1280x1024, 1920x1080, 720x576p50, 1920x1080p50, 720x480, 640x512, 1600x1200, 2560x1440p30 | **same** |
| 12-15 | 1920x1080_NS, 1280x720_NS, 800x600_NS, 640x480_NS | 720x576/720x480 NS PAL/NTSC variants — **differ** (never produced by `zz9k_mode_id`) |
| 16 | 640x400 | same |
| 17 | **1920x800** (the driver's console mode, the tested primary) | **1280x800** |
| 18-22 | — | 1920x1200, 1600x900, 1680x1050, 1366x768, CUSTOM |

Colour modes 0-3 identical; scale bits: bit 0 halves horizontally, bit 1 vertically
(`video.c:1227-1259`). **1920x800 does not exist on the Z3660**: the console geometry and
`zz9k_mode_id()` become row data; the Z3660 console default is proposed as 1920x1080 (id 5,
common to both) — decision 9.4.

### 3.5 Capture / display switch

The Z3660 has no native-video capture input and no path to a native Amiga screen: the firmware
owns the single HDMI output, drives its own boot splash/console into the same framebuffer at
boot (`video.c:245-270,698`), and a guest `MODE` write reprograms that output (`rtg.c:1111-1132`);
`OP_CAPTUREMODE` is a stub, `zz_set_monswitch` is never called, `REG_ZZ_MONITOR_SWITCH 0x318` is a
preset field (Q6, closed). So `SETSWITCH CAPTURE` / "noconsole" cannot restore anything — the
row's `NOCAPTURE` flag makes them no-ops by construction. Which physical panel the demo operator
watches remains a metal observation (A2).

### 3.6 Pitch convention

`video.c:809-812`: VDMA stride = `hsize * (Mm2SStreamWidth>>3)` unless `framebuffer_pan_width`
(= X2 at the last PAN write) is non-zero *and* differs from `hsize/hdiv` (the width in VDMA
words, `hdiv` carrying the colour divisor, `:1246-1255`); a pixel-width X2 lands on the same
stride after `/hdiv` (`:818`). Upstream's sequence (X2=0, PAN=0) is therefore correct on metal;
amiberry needs its fix (§1).

---

## 4. The single switch

### 4.1 Options

| | A. `#ifdef Z3660` at every site | B. probe-time table, always compiled | **C. table + one compile-time row selector** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seams | ~55 (`ZZ9K_REG` uses, `FB_OFFSET` sites, mode table, presence, probe, tools) | 1 table + 1 probe loop + 1 accessor | same as B |
| Fixed-base probe on an AGA machine without a Z3660 | never compiled | **fires** at `0x10000000` with no AutoConfig evidence — a bus-error risk for isoriano's own users | never compiled unless built for the Z3660 |
| One kernel for both cards | no | yes | no — the targets already need different kernels (030 golden vs 060 Model-B) |
| Upstream readability | poor | good, but the safety argument is runtime | good: rows are data; the selector is one Makefile line |

**Recommendation: C.** If a Z3660 signature that is provably safe to read on any AGA machine
ever exists, the selector can become a default-on row without touching the sites.

### 4.2 The delta, exhaustively

`zz9000.h` — additions only; the ABI block is untouched:
```c
/* logical register ids -- the row maps them to offsets; ZZ9K_NOREG = absent on this board */
#define ZZ9K_R_HW_VERSION 0
#define ZZ9K_R_MODE       1
#define ZZ9K_R_PAN        2   /* 32-bit value; 16-bit rows write HI at off, LO at off+2 */
#define ZZ9K_R_X1 3 ... ZZ9K_R_Y2, ZZ9K_R_COLORMODE, ZZ9K_R_SRC, ZZ9K_R_DST, ZZ9K_R_SPLIT_POS,
        ZZ9K_R_FW_VERSION, ZZ9K_R_CAPTURE, ZZ9K_R_ROW_PITCH, ZZ9K_R_X3, ZZ9K_R_Y3, ZZ9K_R_RGB,
        ZZ9K_R_FILLRECT, ZZ9K_R_COPYRECT
#define ZZ9K_NREG   ...
#define ZZ9K_NOREG  0xffff

struct zz9k_modetab { unsigned short width, height, id; };

struct zz9k_boardtab {
    char *name;                   /* "ZZ9000 Zorro II", "Z3660 RTG (fixed)", ... */
    unsigned long autocon_pc;     /* (mfg<<16)|product, 0 = not AutoConfig */
    unsigned long fixed_base;     /* when autocon_pc == 0 */
    unsigned long fixed_size;     /* window size for a fixed row */
    unsigned long fb_offset;      /* device-space offset reported in GETINFO/GETFBINFO */
    unsigned long fb_phys;        /* physical offset of the framebuffer inside the window (== fb_offset on the ZZ9000) */
    unsigned long fb_max;         /* 0 = to end-of-window minus reserved_tail */
    unsigned long reserved_tail;  /* ZZ9000 Z2: 0x20000 */
    unsigned long reg_size;       /* GETREG/SETREG bound: ZZ9000 0x2000, Z3660 0x1000 (keeps the test area out) */
    unsigned short regw;          /* register access width: 2 or 4 */
    unsigned short *regoff;       /* [ZZ9K_NREG] offsets or ZZ9K_NOREG */
    struct zz9k_modetab *modes;   /* width/height -> id, terminated by {0,0,0} */
    unsigned short con_w, con_h;  /* console geometry (must be in `modes`) */
    unsigned short fw_min;        /* 0 = no floor */
    unsigned short zorro, product;/* GETINFO cosmetics */
    unsigned short flags;         /* ZZ9K_BT_REJECT | ZZ9K_BT_AGAGATE | ZZ9K_BT_NOCAPTURE */
};
```
`struct zz9k_board` gains `struct zz9k_boardtab *bt;` and a cached `char *fb` (kernel VA of the
framebuffer). `zz9000.c`:
- `zz9k_rd(bp, r)` / `zz9k_wr(bp, r, v)` / `zz9k_wr32(bp, r, v)`: ~30 lines; a `ZZ9K_NOREG` read
  returns 0xffff, a write is skipped. Every `ZZ9K_REG(bp->base, ZZ9K_REG_X)` site becomes
  `zz9k_wr(bp, ZZ9K_R_X, …)`; `zz9k_write32(PAN_HI/SRC_HI/DST_HI/RGB_HI, v)` becomes
  `zz9k_wr32(bp, ZZ9K_R_PAN/…, v)`. GETREG/SETREG keep raw offsets, bounded by the row's `reg_size` and using its width.
- `zz9k_probe()` loops over the rows: autocon rows as today (REJECT rows keep upstream's
  messages); fixed rows: `AGAGATE` → `VPOSR` `0xDFF004`, `((v>>8)&0x7f) >= 0x22`
  (`z3660.c:720-726`), then `zz9k_present()` on the row (see below), then the siblings'
  direct-map rule `base + window <= 0x40000000` else refuse.
- `zz9k_present()` per row: `FW_VERSION` (and `HW_VERSION` when the row has one) not 0 and not
  all-ones; for the Z3660 additionally `(fw >> 16) == 0`.
- `zz9k_attach()`: `fb_size = fb_max ? fb_max : size - fb_offset - reserved_tail`; `bp->fb = base + fb_phys`.
- Framebuffer address translation for the Z3660's compacted device space (§4.4): one helper
  `zz9k_devphys(bp, off)` used by `zz9000rw`, `zz9000mmap`; kernel-side users take `bp->fb`.
- `zz9k_mode_id()` walks `bp->bt->modes`; the console reads `con_w/con_h` into two statics at
  `zz9k_console_start()` instead of `ZZ9K_CON_WIDTH/HEIGHT`; `ZZ9K_CON_MODE` is looked up.
- `zz9k_set_switch_hw()`: `NOCAPTURE` → return.
- GETINFO reports the row's `zorro`/`product`/`fb_offset`.

`Makefile`: honours two make variables (default empty) folded into `ZCDEFS`/`CFLAGS`:
**`ZZ9K_TARGET`** for the target (`-DZZ9K_TARGET_Z3660`) and **`ZZ9K_BENCH`** for a bench aid
(`-DZZ9K_BENCH_Z3` or `-DZZ9K_BENCH_Z3660`) — two variables because the build hub passes one
token per variable (its `make=` grammar is comma-separated `VAR=token` pairs, no spaces). **Build-hub contract (kerntools c011498):** the chardevs record
carries a `make=` pass-through, e.g. `make=ZZ9K_TARGET=-DZZ9K_TARGET_Z3660`, which lands on the
generated driver rule as `cd zz9000; $(MAKE) ZZ9K_TARGET=…` — so the driver Makefile alone
defines what the variable means, a record without it reproduces upstream byte for byte, and
the target build is a second record (or a `CHARDEVS_CONF=` work conf). No cflags column. `tools/zz9k_test.c`: the autocon gate becomes advisory
(always `PROBE`), `print_z2_expected` prints what `GETINFO` says, `print_regs` uses GETREG at
the row's offsets via a `ZZ9KIOC_GETINFO` field or simply prints MODE/FW through the driver.

Rows compiled in (**corrected on metal, 2026-09-18** — see the box below):
- default: `ZZ9000 Zorro II` (accept, `0x6d6e0003`, fb 0x10000, tail 0x20000, regw 2, ZZ9000
  regoff, ZZ9000 modes, con 1920x800, fw_min 0x010d, zorro 2 product 3) and `ZZ9000 Zorro III`
  (REJECT, `0x6d6e0004`) — upstream's behaviour and messages;
- `-DZZ9K_TARGET_Z3660` adds **`Z3660 RTG`** (the board as AutoConfig lists it, `0x144B0001`: it
  **attaches** when the entry's base is inside the identity map, and is refused with the advice
  "set autoconfig_rtg NO" only when it is not) and **`Z3660 RTG (fixed)`**: base 0x10000000,
  `AGAGATE|NOCAPTURE`, regw 4, Z3660 regoff, Z3660 modes, con 1920x1080 (id 5), reg_size 0x1000,
  fb_offset 0x1000, fb_phys 0x200000, fb_max 0x2E00000 (the AmigaOS driver's 46 MB, `gfx.c:511`),
  fw_min 0x0103 with the test `(fw >> 8) == 1`, zorro 3, product 1.

> **Metal correction (2026-09-18, first boot of the RTG card).** The driver printed
> `zz9000: Z3660 combo board at 0x10000000 size 0x8000000 unsupported` and refused a board it
> can use. The assumption behind the REJECT row — *a board in the AutoConfig table must be the
> `autoconfig_rtg YES` case at `0x40000000`* — is false on real hardware: with
> `autoconfig_rtg NO` the hard-mapped combo **still enters the board list** (it advertises
> itself for SCSI boot, which is how the card boots), so the table lists it at `0x10000000`
> with the 128 MB window. Neither the firmware sources nor the emulator showed this.
> **The discriminator is the base address, not the presence of an entry.** Since 62da6c5+ the
> autocon row carries the full RTG window and attaches when its base is inside the identity
> map; the generic identity-map check refuses it with the advice when it is not, and — the
> second half of the fix — a refused or unanswering row now lets the **next** row try instead
> of ending the probe, which is the sibling drivers' multi-method shape and makes
> `-DZZ9K_BENCH_Z3660` unnecessary (the define is accepted and ignored).

### 4.3 What stays identical

`/dev/zz9000` c 49 0, every ioctl number and struct, `Xzz9000`, `zz9k_test`'s command set,
scripts, the console renderer's behaviour, the safety model (no console takeover from
`init_tbl[]`; late `S99zz9000` only).

### 4.4 Device space on the Z3660: compacted, not raw (decision 9.3)

`Xzz9000` and `zz9k_test` `mmap()` the whole `[0, board_size)` from offset 0 and only ever
touch `base + fb_offset` (`zz9000hw.c:114,136`). If the Z3660 row exposed the *raw* window
(`fb_offset = 0x200000`), the mapping would hand userland RW access to the piscsi mailbox
(`+0x2000`), the boot ROM and the SCSI bounce buffer (`+0x80000`), and the node is `0666`
(`mkdev.sh`). Proposal (accepted, refined twice): after Q8 the device space was the register page followed
by the framebuffer (`fb_offset 0x1000`, bench-proven in step 2); after the 68040/68060 port's
finding that the same page carries the **ethernet driver's doorbells** (`+0x104..+0x1AB`,
`amix-z3660net/src/z3660eth.h`), the Z3660 row's device space is **the framebuffer alone**
(6137966): `fb_offset = 0`, `fb_phys = 0x200000`, `board_size = fb_size = 0x2E00000`;
`zz9k_devphys()` maps every device offset into the framebuffer. Userland never maps the
register page, the firmware's printf-per-access test area, the piscsi mailbox, ROM or bounce;
registers are reached through GETREG/SETREG only, bounded by `reg_size = 0x1000`. `Xzz9000`
and `zz9k_test` are unaffected (they take `fb_offset` from the driver). On the ZZ9000 rows
`fb_phys == fb_offset` and the helper is the identity. Alternative: raw window + a `0600`
node; simpler, and leaves the hazard.

### 4.5 Not in v1

`autoconfig_rtg YES` (window above the identity map, `sptalloc` pool too small for a
framebuffer); a real ZZ9000 product 4 (same argument); the hardware blitter (dead in upstream
too); the DMA-op/GFXData path (AmigaOS-only convenience).

## 5. Open questions for `FIRMWARE-RTG-INTERFACE.md` (or the metal)

| # | Question | Why it matters | Preliminary answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | ~~Is the hard-map at `0x10000000` unconditional under `autoconfig_rtg NO`?~~ **closed**: gated by exactly `autoconfig_rtg` (`main.c:1694`), both boot modes (`main.c:1436,1440,1662-1665`), no other knob | the fixed row's base | ✅ |
| Q2 | ~~Real-CPU path: 2 MB forwarded, FB direct, byte order, landing order~~ **closed** except the FPGA byte-lane wiring of the direct FB window (A1, a 16-bit bar fill on metal confirms) | console/X performance | ✅ / A1 |
| Q3 | Presence signature: `0x1A0` = `0x0103`, test `(v >> 8) == 1`; `+0x000` reads `0xFFFFFFFF` so it must never be probed; `FW_ALFA` is a build counter — **the no-board/uninitialised limb stays UNSETTLED (= A4, bus/FPGA behaviour)** | `zz9k_present()`; the open-bus test | `0x0103` ✅; A4 ❓ |
| Q4 | ~~Framebuffer envelope~~ **closed**: `[+0x200000, +0x3000000)` is clear; first client above is GFXData `+0x3200000`; the 46 MB bound is the AmigaOS driver's, safe to reuse; the firmware writes there only for its boot splash | `fb_phys`, `fb_max`, `board_size` | ✅ |
| Q5 | Mode list: ids 5/17/18/19/20/21 are all 60 Hz HDMI timings (`video.c:108,120-124`) — **the demo monitor's lock is the only open part (A6, metal)** | console default; `Xzz9000` mode choice | table ✅, monitor ❓ |
| Q6 | ~~What is on the HDMI before any mode is set; is there a way back?~~ **closed** for the firmware: its own boot splash; one output; no native path (`video.c:245-270`, `rtg.c:1905-1908`). **A2 closed (2026-09-16):** the native console is the Amiga RGB output (what the RGB capture sees); the Z3660's RTG HDMI is behind a hand-flipped HDMI switch — the two are never on the capture at once, and enabling RTG cannot disturb the console the operator reads on RGB | "noconsole" = no-op; demo safety: RTG never takes the RGB console; metal recipe in blocks (§6 step 4) | ✅ |
| Q11 | Which layer sets the VM limit for the X server on metal — the X startup script (`ulimit -v`), the login class, or the kernel's rlimit default — and what the 060 kernel's default is | `Xzz9000` mmaps 46 MB on the Z3660 row | bench: shell default 16 MB soft, hard unlimited; metal ❓ |
| Q7 | ~~16-bit accesses to the register file~~ **closed**: whole aligned longword dispatched, no size decode (`rtg.c:583`, `:779,:1042`) — 32-bit only | `regw` | ✅ |
| Q8 | ~~The firmware "test area" `0x1000-0x1FFF`~~ **closed**: raw memory, **unconditional** printf per access, nothing else decodes there → excluded from the row's device space (`reg_size`/`fb_offset` 0x1000) | mmap/GETREG bound | ✅ |
| Q9 | ~~Under `autoconfig_rtg YES`, the product byte the ROM reports on metal~~ — **closed by the adversarial check**: `0x01` on the emulated path (`cpu_emulator.cpp:338-345`), the FPGA path (`z3660.v:981`) and the documented real-CPU board list (`docs/real-cpu-autoconfig-and-ext-rom.md:21,96-102`) | the REJECT row's autocon code | `0x144B0001` ✅ |
| Q10 | ~~Cache attribute expected from the 68k side~~ **closed**: firmware sets ARM-side only (registers non-cached, FB write-through, `defines.h:9,12`); 68k side: registers CI/serialized (the `REG1` handshake), FB CI or WT-with-flush — `DTT0` CI is correct | 060 metal correctness | ✅ |

## 6. Bench plan

All bench steps run on the kerntools piscsi rig via amix-kerntools, with the
2026-09-15 recipe (clean-build gate sum, `bootinfo.autocon[]` decode, driver boot
lines, `zz9k_test` transcript, IPC `SCREENSHOT`, native console restored). Mechanics: `nohup`
tests through amixrun; ~0.4x wall clock with the window hammered.

| Step | Kernel / emulation | Proves | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 regression** | golden 030 build of this repo, default rows — kerntools record repointed to `overlay/…` (c011498), **no `make=`**; `gfxcard_type=ZZ9000_Z2 gfxcard_size=4` | the table + accessor refactor changed nothing | boot lines as 09684 modulo wording; bars 1920x800; console test; `fb 0x10000+0x3d0000`; `MODE readback 0x0111` (ZZ9000 rows only — the Z3660's MODE is write-only, §3.3) |
| **1 32-bit window rehearsal — PASS 2026-09-16** (kernel 40227; rig report `31-report.md`; one finding: the process VM rlimit, §8) | same kernel + a **bench-only** row accepting ZZ9000 product 4 inside the identity map (record `make=ZZ9K_TARGET=-DZZ9K_BENCH_Z3` as run; from now on `make=ZZ9K_BENCH=-DZZ9K_BENCH_Z3`); amiberry `gfxcard_type=ZZ9000_Z3 gfxcard_size=128 z3mapping=uae` → `0x10000000`, `er_type 0x83`, FB `+0x10000` (`amiberry src/gfxboard.cpp:444-455`, `src/expansion.cpp:296-308`) | kernel dereference of a window at `0x10000000` (console, FILL, rw); user `mmap` above 16 MB with 2 KiB `phystopfn`; `board_size` capped by `fb_max` | bars + console; a `devmaptest`-style aliasing check on the mapping |
| **2 Z3660 hard-map rehearsal — PASS 2026-09-16** (kernel 40217, bytes c5a5a46, amiberry stand-in 814d25c; rig report `31-report.md`) | record `make=ZZ9K_TARGET=-DZZ9K_TARGET_Z3660,ZZ9K_BENCH=-DZZ9K_BENCH_Z3660` (the second define drops the combo REJECT row: amiberry's piscsi *model* AutoConfigures as `0x144B0001`, which on metal would mean `autoconfig_rtg YES` and rightly stop the probe before the fixed row); amiberry fork gains a **Z3660-RTG stand-in**: a thin bank at `0x10000000`, no AutoConfig (precedent `debugmem_bank`, `src/memory.cpp:1536,2755-2764`), that **translates the Z3660's 32-bit `0x100`-based registers onto the existing `zz9000.cpp` handlers**, FB at `+0x200000`, FW `0x0103`, no HW_VERSION, Z3660 mode ids — amiberry-agent work, cross-repo ask; rig must run `chipset=aga` for the gate | the fixed row end-to-end: gate, presence, no autocon entry, compacted device space, `zz9k_test` without its gate, X-style mmap | boot line `zz9000: Z3660 RTG at 0x10000000 …`; bars; console at the row's geometry; `GETAUTOCON` shows no RTG entry; mmap never reaches `+0x2000..` physical |
| **3 register fidelity** | as 2 after `FIRMWARE-RTG-INTERFACE.md` | §3.3/§3.4 verified against the doc; stand-in corrected where the doc differs | row values == doc |
| **4 metal — PASS** (candidate-2 kernel, metal session 2 rows 0–7 incl. OpenLook on the Z3660 HDMI; A4000D; `docs/DEMO-RTG.md`). *Plan text below as of 2026-09-16.* | **Rule (2026-09-16): RTG goes onto the demo machine only after the demo cards are fully ready.** 68LC060 Model-B kernel (`amix-040-060-port`, relink script + Model-B sysroot/converter); the Z3660 firmware side drives the A4000D **after 2026-09-19**, never the demo media. **Display topology (2026-09-16):** the RGB capture sees only the Amiga RGB output; the Z3660's RTG HDMI goes through an HDMI switch flipped by hand — RTG is visible only with someone at the switch, and while RTG is on the capture the native console is not (and vice versa). The recipe therefore runs in **blocks**: console-side steps (boot lines, `mkdev`, tool build, `zz9k_test` up to "pattern active") on the RGB capture, a switch flip, RTG-side checks (bars, console test, X), a flip back — and **every RTG-side check has a serial/telnet-visible confirmation** (driver boot lines, the `zz9k_test` transcript, a `dd`/`od` readback of the framebuffer, `Xzz9000`'s log) so the run is decidable without the frame | the real firmware; 4 KiB `phystopfn`; DTT0 CI; the runtime VM limit (§8) | driver boot line and transcripts on the RGB capture; bars on the RTG HDMI when the switch is flipped to it, with the framebuffer readback as the frame-independent proof; `Xzz9000` up per its log |

The amiberry `zz_set_pan` bug blocks the visual pass of every step until the fork fixes it
(`bench/zzpanfix.c` workaround meanwhile; the driver is not changed for it).

## 7. The native compiler constraint

**Bench:** GNU GCC **1.40.5** (68k, SGS/AT&T syntax), `/usr/sys/Makefile` `CC = gcc`, measured
(`31-report-resume.md`; kerntools `docs/zz9000-rig.md:75-81`). Upstream's C compiles clean;
only `-fno-builtin` (gcc 2.x) is rejected, stripped at push time. **Metal:** cross
`m68k-cbm-sysv4-gcc 2.7.2.3` + the port's Model-B sysroot (`amix-040-060-port/include-modelb/
sys/immu.h`, `param.h`) or its per-driver converter (`src/z3660_modelb.py`).

| Construct | In upstream? | 1.40.5 | 2.7.2.3 | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K&R definitions, bare externs (`extern int autocon();`) | throughout | ok | ok | every new function K&R |
| ANSI prototypes, `void *` arithmetic, `enum`, `//`, `const`, `typedef` | none in the driver | — | — | do not introduce (the row struct uses `unsigned short *` etc.) |
| `UL` suffixes (`zz9000.h:14-16,52-54,86-87`) | yes | ok (compiled) | ok | fine |
| `-Dinline=__inline__`, `#include "sys/inline.h"` (`zz9000.c:15`) | yes | ok | ok | keep |
| `-fno-builtin` | Makefile | **rejected** | ok | leave upstream's Makefile; kerntools strips it |
| `-traditional` | Makefile | ok | ok | the cross kernel build uses `-D__STDC__=0` instead because `<sys/immu.h>` has `void` prototypes (`amix-kerntools/build-cross-kernel.sh:544-548,636-640`) — a flag-set matter for the metal script |
| GNU inline asm, `register … __asm__("d0")`, clobbers | **none** | rejected (`amix-z3660scsi` d90f5fd: `invalid register name 'd0'`) | ok | never add; `VPOSR` needs none; cache asm → `.s` |
| static `unsigned char` array initialisers (`zz9000.c:528-573`) | yes | ok | ok | fine |
| `spl6/splx`, `bzero/memset` | not used | — | — | keep it that way |
| `phystopfn()` (`zz9000.c:1246`) | yes | `pa >> 11` (2 KiB) | per the sysroot's `PNUMSHFT` | **the trap**: correct on the bench kernel; on Model-B it must compile against the port's `immu.h` or be converted, else `mmap` lands at 2×pa. Never hand-roll the shift; size nothing in pages |
| 32-bit volatile MMIO (`*(volatile unsigned long *)`) | not in upstream; both siblings use it (`z3660.c:232-233`) | ok | ok | the Z3660 row's accessor |

---

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Retired by |
|---|---|
| Register file differs (this document's central finding) — the port is a register-map port, not an identity swap | the accessor + per-row `regoff`; bench step 2's translating stand-in; step 3 against the firmware doc; step 4 |
| A 16-bit access leaks into the Z3660 path | `regw` is the only width source; GETREG/SETREG use it too |
| Framebuffer envelope shared with other clients | §3.2 layout + `fb_max = 0x2E00000` (the AmigaOS driver's own bound); Q4 |
| Userland RW over the piscsi mailbox/bounce via `mmap(board_size)` | compacted device space (§4.4) |
| Userland or GETREG loop over the firmware test area stalls the RTG thread on UART printfs | the row's device space and `reg_size` end at `0x1000` (§4.4) |
| Presence test false-negative (`FW_VERSION` numbering) or false-positive (open bus) | row-specific test; compile-time gate; AGA gate |
| No 1920x800 → console `ENXIO`, `Xzz9000` mode failure | per-row mode table + console geometry; Q5 |
| Capture switch is a stub: "noconsole"/`SETSWITCH CAPTURE` cannot give the display back | `NOCAPTURE`; Q6 decides what "restore" means on metal; nothing runs from `init_tbl[]` |
| 060 copy-back cache over the framebuffer | DTT0 CI on the low 1 GB (`z3660.c:688-709`); assert at attach like the siblings |
| 060 4 KiB `phystopfn` | Model-B sysroot / converter; aliasing check |
| **A process cannot `mmap()` the window under Amix's default per-process VM limit** — the login shell's `RLIMIT_VMEM` soft default is 16 MB (`ulimit -a` memory(kbytes) 16384; hard unlimited): `mmap(board_size)` of the 47 MB bench window returned ENOMEM, every size ≥ 16 MB failed and ≤ 12 MB succeeded; with `ulimit -v 131072` the same kernel mapped all 23 584 pages and the bars drew (step 1, `23-mmap-size-probe.txt`). Never visible on a real ZZ9000 (4 MB window) | **runtime contract**: whatever opens `/dev/zz9000` and maps `board_size` — `Xzz9000` (46 MB on the Z3660 row), `zz9k_test` — must run with `RLIMIT_VMEM` ≥ its own VM + `board_size`: `ulimit -v` in the X startup script, or a raised kernel rlimit default (Q11). `zz9k_test` restores the display and prints the hint on an mmap failure. Upstream-relevant for isoriano's Zorro III users |
| The demo machine's display is taken over by a bench-minded test | metal only after 2026-09-19 via the Z3660 firmware side; no `S99zz9000` on the demo media *(2026-09-16 wording)* |
| amiberry pitch bug masks regressions | **fixed in the amiberry fork (71e7527)**: step 2 rendered with X2=0/PAN=0 and no workaround; `zzpanfix.c` is no longer needed on the current fork |
| `read(2)` at or past `board_size` returns ENXIO rather than a 0-byte EOF | upstream's `zz9000rw` semantics, kept: a device window is fail-closed; documented in the recipes |

---

## 9. Decisions (project, 2026-09-15)

1. **ACCEPTED — device identity stays `/dev/zz9000`, major 49, ABI unchanged**: one driver, two
   rows, `Xzz9000` unchanged. (The grimoire's major registry presumes a separate driver; it
   is to be corrected.)
2. **ACCEPTED — switch shape = option C**: board table + compile-time row selector
   `-DZZ9K_TARGET_Z3660`, no `#ifdef` inside functions; the default build reproduces upstream
   behaviour, bench step 0 is the proof.
3. **ACCEPTED — compacted device space on the Z3660** (`fb_offset 0x2000`, `fb_phys 0x200000`).
4. **Console geometry for the Z3660 row: default 1920x1080 (id 5)**; whether
   the demo monitor wants 1280x800 is open — the console mode stays a one-line table value.
5. **Bench-only product-4 row (`-DZZ9K_BENCH_Z3`) kept** as a documented bench aid until the
   step-2 stand-in exists; revisit then.
6. Cross-repo asks, filed with the project: kerntools is repointing its chardevs record to
   this repo (the old sibling `zz9000-amix` path aborts every build) — **the target build is the
   record's `make=ZZ9K_TARGET=…` pass-through** (kerntools c011498, §4.2), one record per build;
   the amiberry pan-pitch fix and the Z3660-RTG stand-in bank wait for review of
   the amiberry merge; the Z3660 firmware side gets Q1–Q10 (`docs/FIRMWARE-RTG-INTERFACE.md`); the
   040/060-port relink question waits until after 2026-09-19.
7. §0 and §3.3 are written so that the register-file finding can go to isoriano as-is.

## 10. Assumptions I could not verify from source

- That the real-CPU (68060) framebuffer window from `+0x200000` is byte-order-transparent for
  16-bit and 32-bit stores, and that the FPGA has landed a register write in DDR before it
  raises REG1 (`rtg.c:557`) — both are FPGA behaviour, not visible in C (`z3660.v` was read
  only for the autoconfig nibbles).
- Which physical panel the demo operator watches (the Z3660's HDMI shows the firmware splash, then RTG; the native Amiga screen has no path through the Z3660) (A2).
- That reading `0x10000000+0x1A0` on an AGA machine *without* a Z3660 bus-errors rather than
  returning open-bus data (the reason the row is compile-time gated; not testable here).
- The demo monitor's accepted modes (Q5).
- That the Model-B kernel's `segdev` mmap path accepts a device window at `0x10000000` (the
  port's `devmaptest` covered `/dev/mem`; the VA2000 driver covered a Zorro II window).

---

## 11. RTG in the demo — what it would take on the real 060 (2026-09-16 assessment)

The rule of §6 step 4 stands. This section defines the work so that it can be judged. Facts from `amix-040-060-port` are
cited; the 68040/68060 port's answer to the A7 question is merged where it differs.

### 11.1 The kernel

The demo runs a 68LC060 Model-B kernel from the port's relink machinery: the baseline
`68060-260812-06` is `relink-040.sh` on the stock `stand/unix` (`STATUS.md:48,67`); the "r13"
in use is the FPE round-13 lineage `unix-060-fpe-r13-CARD1` (buildid `68060-260828-50`,
`docs/contracts/FPE-R10-VEC60.md:1226-1247`; the kernel `zen0` was verified on 2026-09-09).
**Any RTG kernel is a NEW kernel** = that base + this driver, produced by a new relink script
in the port's style; it is not the kerntools 030 pipeline (whose on-box `ed` wiring is
030-only in execution).

### 11.2 The relink shape for a `cdevsw` + `mmap` char driver (A7) — measured in r13 by the 68040/68060 port

Source: the 68040/68060 port's measured answer (every claim
with a `file:line`; the r13 artifact is the archived master `unix-060-fpe-r13-CARD1-ced0s1-metal-green-2026-08-28`).

| Step | Fact (r13, measured) | For zz9000 |
|---|---|---|
| Row 49 | **free**: `cdevsw` @ `.data 0x9dd4`, 70 rows × 52 B; row 49 @ `0xa7c8` = ten `R_68K_32 nodev` at +0..+0x24, no reloc at +0x28/+0x2c, `nullflag` @ +0x30 — the same shape as rows 68 (VA2000) and 51 (zen0) | `patch_va2000_cdevsw.py` with `CDEVSW_MAJOR=49`, `EXPECT_SLOT_OFF=0xa7c8`: retargets `d_open..d_mmap`, all-or-nothing |
| Init | `init_tbl` (0x9308) and `io_init` (0x99a4: `parinit`, NULL) have no spare slot; r13's `parinit` is **already the z3660 wrapper** (`000f7510 T parinit`, `0000fe6c T parinit_orig`), so the VA2000 script's `PARINIT_ADDR=0xfe6c` aborts on it | chain a second wrapper the FPE way (`relink-040-fpe.sh:175,187`): `--weaken-symbol parinit --add-symbol parinit_z3660=.text:0xf7510`, link `jsr zz9000init; jmp parinit_z3660; .balign 4` last → io_init → zz9000 → z3660 → stock. This runs at **io_init time, before `init_tbl`** — fine: `zz9000init` needs only `bootinfo` (loader-filled), `VPOSR`, the board registers and `printf` |
| Where | r13 = `relink-040.sh → -z3660.sh → -f4arms.sh --ufault --cache 60 → -f6.sh --kvd --swa (= build/unix-040-f7vs, pinned, sha d43a59cc…) → -fpe.sh → stamp-card1 → stamp-cputype --set 60`; FPE is always the last link | the RTG pass sits **between f6 and fpe, starting from the pinned f7vs** (a fresh `relink-040.sh` today carries change D and does not reproduce r13's base) |
| Compile | `AMIX_KERNEL_CFLAGS` with `-m68020→-m68040`, `AMIX_SYSROOT=build/sysroot-modelb`, `-traditional` (no `-D__STDC__=0` anywhere), then `check_page_geometry.sh`; `scan060.py` by hand (no script gates it): `-O` turns `x / CONST` into a 64-bit `mulsl` → vector 61 in supervisor mode | **done and clean** (6137966): compiled exactly so; `check_page_geometry.sh` → one shift by 12; `scan060.py` → 0 hits (the previous object had two `mulsl #1717986919` from the console test's `/10`, now a loop) |
| Symbols (`nm -S` r13) | `autocon` T, `bootinfo` D 1900 B, `conputc` **D 4 B** (function-pointer variable → `coputc`; readers `putchar`, writers only `bbopen/bbclose`; `consinit` never touches it, so a runtime assignment persists), `copyin` T, `copyout` T (the port's wrapper, intended), `printf` T, `uiomove` T — **`builtinfont` ABSENT** (the kernel has `scr_builtinfonts` → local `font0base/font1base`; `sunfont` absent); the leak check fails the link on any `U` | `-DZZ9K_NO_BUILTINFONT` (6137966) drops the extern: the object's U set is exactly {autocon bootinfo conputc copyin copyout printf uiomove}; the console uses its built-in glyphs (a font object can be added later) |
| Link | the `.o` on the `ld -r` line, closer object last; guards: `check_relink_relocs.py`, `patch_b2_flip --check`, `stamp_buildid`; `unix_boot040` mandatory (330 PC-rel relocs) | a cloned `relink-040-zz9000.sh` |
| Window sharing | the RTG register page `+0x000..+0xFFF` **contains the ethernet driver's register block `+0x104..+0x1AB`**; FB `+0x200000..+0x2FFFFFF` overlaps nothing (piscsi `+0x2000/+0x80000`, eth frames `+0x7ED0000`); the 128 MB window spans the eth ring | the Z3660 row never writes `0x104`, and from 6137966 its userland device space is **the framebuffer alone** (no register page mapped; GETREG/SETREG only, root, `0x1000`-bounded); mmap offsets are bounded to `FB_MAX` by construction |
| Cache | `DTT0 = 0x003fc060` = 0–1 GB CI for kernel VAs (`pstart040.s:326-327`); a **user** mmap of the FB is outside DTT0 → leaf-PTE mode; r13 has no `hat_cm_fb_add` (change D absent) → default NCS serialised: coherent, slow | acceptable for the demo (CPU fills of 4 MB frames); note ISSUE-49 (segdev calls `d_mmap` twice per 4 KiB page, second wins — harmless here) and ISSUE-47 (a map of a non-responding address retries forever — the presence test runs first) |
| `RLIMIT_VMEM` | r13 `rlimits` (D 0x9390): VMEM {16 MiB soft, 0x7fffffff hard}, byte-identical to stock; a device mmap counts (`spec_segmap → as_map`, ENOMEM); `RLIMIT_DATA` also 16 MiB (gates `brk` for an X heap) | tools: `zz9k_test` now raises its own soft limit (`setrlimit`, libc `sysent[128]`); `zz9k_demo` also `ulimit -v`; for X: `ulimit -v` in its startup, or a 4-byte stamp at `rlimits+0x30` (a `stamp-cputype.py`-pattern tool, a first for the port) |

### 11.3 What it would show, and what it cannot

- **Can, on a relinked r13 + driver:** the RTG HDMI at 1920x1080 (or 1280x800): the bar and
  fill/copy pictures and the console test page (`zz9k_demo`); **any command's output on the RTG
  screen** through `zz9k_cat` (`ZZ9KIOC_CONPUTS`, no kernel hook); kernel messages on RTG through
  the `conputc` redirect (the kernel `printf` funnel — userland VT writes do not pass through it).
- **A real login shell on the RTG screen** is reachable without console source, per the 68040/68060
  port: 2.1c has no `c1write`; the function at upstream's hook position is `scrcon_put(cp,p,n)`
  (`00005284 T`, byte-identical to stock, called from `getoblk` for every VT write and from
  `coputc`), and the port's sanctioned override (`--weaken-symbol scrcon_put --add-symbol
  scrcon_put_orig=.text:0x5284`, a ~10-instruction first-party asm wrapper: load `cp->screen`,
  compare `displayedscreen`, `jsr zz9000consolewrite(p,n)`, `rts` if nonzero else `jmp
  scrcon_put_orig`) binds both callers; keyboard stays native. Not built; an inference marked
  as such by the 68040/68060 port.
- **No X** (`Xzz9000` is blocked on the native compiler). *(True on 2026-09-16; since superseded — cross-built 2026-09-18, `docs/X-CROSS.md`, and run on metal, `docs/DEMO-RTG.md` row 7.)*
- **Display topology** (§6 step 4): RTG on the hand-flipped HDMI; RGB console on the RGB capture.

### 11.4 Effort, re-validation, and what changes on the card

- **Effort (68040/68060 port):** the pass itself — a cloned `relink-040-zz9000.sh` (nm-read weaken
  chain, the two-constant cdevsw patcher, closer last, existing guards) — **is a day**, given a
  driver that compiles clean against `include-modelb` with `scan060` clean (now the case); **the
  long pole is metal**.
- **Re-validation:** `docs/ACCEPTANCE.md` has no "one more driver" clause; the applicable §3 row
  is "glue a variant links — device code → host gates + a boot of that variant + a test aimed at
  what the glue does", plus §4 host gates (`TOTAL complaints: 0`), boot identity + every magic
  word (they move when `.text` changes, FPE-R10-VEC60 §13.9), §5 the historical-eleven battery
  (≈90 s–2 min), §6 the 060 rows (`fp060probe 7/7`, `ftest060`, `isp61ea 7/7`, `fpenab060`,
  `fputest060 fork`), the r13 RESULTS rows the demo relies on, the multiuser band, and the §8
  client on the RTG. `docs/PLATFORM-LC060-Z3660.md` caps real-CPU runs at 15 min and forbids
  unattended boots. **Calibration:** r13 itself never ran §5/§7/§8 on the LC060 — its metal
  acceptance was one 40-minute session on 2026-08-28 plus later boots to multiuser; "more than
  r13 did" is a separate decision. kerntools' floor (`nm -u` clean, boot, attach line, `mkdev`, one
  mode-set + bars) is the minimum the driver side would ask for.
- **On the card:** the new kernel (a second kernel file or a separate medium), `/dev/zz9000`
  (`mkdev.sh`), the tools under `/usr/amiga/bin`. No preset or firmware change (`autoconfig_rtg
  NO` is what the driver wants; ZTop/firmware on 0: stays F492BEC1).

### 11.5 What the metal probe of 2026-09-16 retires before any kernel exists

**Metal fact (run 1, A4000D, r13, preset 7):** a user-space `mmap()` of `/dev/mem` at physical
`0x08000000` returned `2f004eb9` where `lseek+read` of the same longword returned `46fc2700`;
the probe's self-test refused the mapping and the card was never touched (the HDMI stayed on the
firmware's 800x600 splash — Q6's "before" answered). **Mechanism (68040/68060 port, by disassembly of
four kernels):** the port's ISSUE-46 — `mmmmap` computes `pfn = (offset + 0xfff) >> 12` and the
retained 2 KiB segdev stepping calls `d_mmap` twice per 4 KiB page, so every `/dev/mem` mapping
lands one page high (`2f004eb9` = `.text+0x1000`; `KNOWN-ISSUES.md:4410-4470`,
`REALHW-Z3-APERTURE-PROBE-260819.md:14-22` recorded the identical pair before the fix). The fix
(`patch_devmmap2.py`, 4 bytes in `mmmmap`) is in the fresh `relink-040.sh` base but **not in the
pinned f7vs, r13 or the candidate**. `/dev/zz9000` never goes through `mmmmap` (`zz9000mmap`
truncates via `phystopfn`, like the unaffected `scrmmap`/`va2000mmap`), so this is **neutral** on
the driver's own mapping. The mapping's cache class is **NCS** on r13 / candidate 2 / candidate 3
(no `hat_cm_fb` table in those binaries; unmanaged device pages take `Lcm_dev` = `oril #0x40`;
`hat_cm_ram` is for managed pages only — 68040/68060 port, `HAT-CM-FB-R13.md`, 2026-09-27, correcting
the earlier "deferred TODO" reading). NC is possible only on the driver-line base, by registering
the window with `hat_cm_fb_add` at attach (X server fix 5). `/dev/mem` mmap is not an oracle on any r13-lineage kernel; the 68040/68060
port recommends leaving r13's bytes alone for the demo. It **raises the bar for validating
`zz9000mmap` on the metal**: the first thing
a relinked kernel must show is a `devmaptest`-style aliasing check on `/dev/zz9000` (map the same
page twice and two adjacent pages, compare with `read(2)` of the same offsets) before `zz9k_test`
draws through the mapping — `tools/zz9k_maptest` (d85c037) is that check, and `zz9k_test … rw`
draws through `write(2)` so the pictures never depend on the mapping. The same binary ran the whole sequence on the amiberry stand-in
(signature, mode, bars, 16-bit lanes `0000/0103`, `f800f800` row readback), so A1 stands on
emulation. Run 2 (`-r`: every access an `lseek`+`read`/`write` on `/dev/mem`, kernel-executed)
**passed on the metal** at 1920x1080 and 1280x800: signature `00000103` (the driver's first
access, kernel-executed), framebuffer write/read self-test `MATCH`, the mode-set sequence
acknowledged by the firmware's serial (`video_mode_init: 5 … 1920x1080 16 bit color, 60 Hz`;
`17 … 1280x800`), `f800f800` row readback, bars/blue/bars on the Z3660 HDMI (frames). A1 (byte
order of 16-bit stores on the FPGA path), A6 (both modes lock) and Q6 (the firmware splash
before) are answered on metal; see `docs/DEMO-RTG.md`.


`tools/zz9k_memprobe` (root, `/dev/mem`, no driver) exercises on the real LC060 exactly the
accesses the driver's Z3660 row makes: the 32-bit signature read at `0x100001A0`, the 16-bit
lane reads (A1), the mode-set write sequence, 16-bit framebuffer stores at `+0x200000` and
their byte order, and the HDMI output (A6, Q6). If it draws the bars, the driver's metal risk
reduces to the relink mechanics of §11.2. Result: see `docs/DEMO-RTG.md`.
