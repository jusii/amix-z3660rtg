# FIRMWARE-RTG-INTERFACE.md — questions for the Z3660 firmware side

> **Out-of-repo citations.** Run artefacts (reports, transcripts, frames) are cited by file name. They, sibling repositories and archived images are kept outside this repo and are not needed to build or use the driver.

**Purpose.** The amix-z3660rtg driver's Z3660 row (DESIGN.md §4.2) is built from a preliminary
read of the firmware and AmigaOS-driver sources (DESIGN.md §3). This sheet lists what still needs
the Z3660 firmware side's word — each question says *why it matters*, *where the answer lives*
(a firmware source line, or one read on the metal), and *what we currently assume*. Please
answer in place under **Answer:** (with a citation or the metal observation), leave the
question text alone, and mark anything you cannot settle as `UNSETTLED` with the reason. A separate
long-form answer document may exist beside it; this file is the merge target the driver row is generated from.

**Merged 2026-09-15** from the Z3660 firmware side's answer sheet (verbatim copy:
`docs/FIRMWARE-ANSWERS-2026-09-15.md`; firmware branch `amix-main-2`, source-only). Status tags:
CLOSED = settled from source; METAL = only a metal read can finish it; UNSETTLED = outside the
firmware's C (bus/FPGA behaviour). The firmware side's `rtg.c` line numbers can differ from
DESIGN.md's by a few lines (same branch, a doc commit apart).

Paths: `FW/` = `Z3660/z3660-firmware/Z-TURN/vitis_ide/`, `DRV/` = `Z3660/z3660-drivers/`.
Every "metal read" below is a **read**; nothing here asks for a write on the demo machine,
and nothing is to be done on the metal before 2026-09-19. *(Rule of 2026-09-15; the METAL items were later closed on metal — see A1, A2, A6.)*

## Q1 — The hard-map at `0x10000000` under `autoconfig_rtg NO`

- **Need:** confirmation that the RTG/combo window is at guest `0x10000000` whenever
  `autoconfig_rtg NO`, in every Amix preset and both boot modes (`CPU` and the emulated
  ones), and that no other knob (`amix_mode`, `amix_ram`, `autoconfig_ram`, a preset overlay)
  moves or disables it.
- **Why:** the Z3660 row's `fixed_base`; the AGA-gated probe reads there without any AutoConfig
  evidence.
- **Where:** `FW/Z3660_emu/src/cpu_emulator.cpp:221-236` (`reset_autoconfig`), the real-CPU
  equivalent in the FPGA/firmware (`z3660.v` / whatever configures the bridge window for
  `bootmode CPU`), `config_file.c` for the knobs; on metal: the firmware's boot print
  `[Core1] Autoconfig RTG to 0x1000`.
- **We assume:** unconditional when `z3_enabled & 2 == 0`.
- **Answer:** **CLOSED.** The gate is exactly `autoconfig_rtg`: `shared->z3_enabled |= config.autoconfig_rtg ? 2 : 0`
  (`FW/Z3660/src/main.c:1694`). Emulated modes: `reset_autoconfig()` plants `0x10000000` and marks
  it configured (`cpu_emulator.cpp:221-226`). Real-CPU mode: `DISABLE_RTG_AUTOCONFIG` and the RTG
  window at MB index `0x100` (`main.c:1436,1440,1662-1665`). `amix_mode`/`amix_ram`/`autoconfig_ram`
  only shape the RAM window below; both map branches lay `dmmy_bank` over `0x10000000-0x17FFFFFF`
  which `init_rtg_bank()` overlays (`uae_emulator.cpp:1223-1225`), and the amix RAM window is clamped
  so it "can never run into the combo board window" (`:1180-1194`).

## Q2 — The real-CPU (68060) bus path for the window

- **Need:** (a) that every 68k access in the first 2 MB (`+0x000000..+0x1FFFFF`) is delivered
  to `rtg_thread()` and nothing in that range is decoded by the FPGA on its own; (b) that
  the framebuffer from `+0x200000` is a direct DDR window (no per-access ARM handling) for
  the real CPU; (c) the byte order the real CPU sees for 16-bit and 32-bit stores into the
  framebuffer (the emulated path `swap16/swap32`s; the FPGA path is not visible in C); (d)
  whether the FPGA has landed a register write in DDR before it raises `REG1`
  (`FW/Z3660/src/rtg/rtg.c:557`).
- **Why:** console and X performance (CPU fill loops of 16-bit pixels), and the correctness
  of every register write.
- **Where:** `z3660.v` (bus bridge), `rtg.c:552-720`; on metal: after a mode is set, a
  `zz9k_test`-style 16-bit bar fill visibly correct = (b)+(c) answered.
- **We assume:** (a) yes (`gpio & 0x1FFFFF`, `rtg.c:570`); (b) yes (`rtg_bank` from bank
  `0x1020`); (c) big-endian transparent; (d) yes.
- **Answer:** **CLOSED (a,b,d); (c) source model only, METAL residue = A1.** (a) `zaddr = gpio & 0x1FFFFF`
  (`rtg.c:570-571,644`) — the first 2 MB is forwarded to the ARM, nothing there is served by the
  FPGA alone. (b) the framebuffer from `+0x200000` is a direct DDR window: `rtg_bank` is
  `ABFLAG_RAM | ABFLAG_DIRECTACCESS`, 128 MB, `baseaddr = RTG_BASE` (`uae_emulator.cpp:972,984-990`),
  never seen by `rtg_thread()`. (c) big-endian transparent: the ARM path `swap32/swap16`s only to
  undo its own little-endianness (`rtg.c:570,583,602,655`). (d) the ARM reads the payload back out of
  DDR (`swap32(*address)`, `rtg.c:570,583`) — landed before `REG1` is raised.

## Q3 — The presence signature

- **Need:** the value of `REG_ZZ_FW_VERSION` (`0x1A0`) as a 32-bit read on the shipped
  firmware and on every firmware the demo might carry; whether `FW_BETA` (`0x280`) /
  `FW_ALFA` (`0x284`) are stable; what a 32-bit read at `+0x000` and at `+0x1A0` returns on
  a Z3660 whose RTG is *disabled* or not yet initialised (open-bus `0xFFFFFFFF`? zero? a
  bus error?).
- **Why:** `zz9k_present()` for the Z3660 row; the driver must never attach to an absent
  RTG and must never hang the boot.
- **Where:** `rtg.c:805-814`, `FW/Z3660/src/version.h`; the AmigaOS driver's own test is
  `fwrev >> 8 == 1` (`DRV/rtg/gfx.c:488-495`); on metal: one 32-bit peek at `0x100001A0`.
- **We assume:** `0x0103`, test `(v >> 8) == 1`.
- **Answer:** **CLOSED for a mapped RTG; UNSETTLED for the no-board/uninitialised limb (= A4).** `0x1A0` =
  `(REVISION_MAJOR<<8)|REVISION_MINOR` = `0x0103` (`rtg.c:805-807`, `version.h:1-2`); `FW_BETA 0x280`
  = 21 (stable), `FW_ALFA 0x284` = 0 in-tree, a build counter — informational only. `+0x000` reads
  `0xFFFFFFFF` (`rtg.c:1024-1026`) — **never probe `+0x000`**; probe `+0x1A0` and test
  `(v >> 8) == 1`. Under NO the bank is mapped at CPU reset (`cpu_emulator.cpp:117,137`), so it is
  live by guest boot.

## Q4 — The framebuffer envelope

- **Need:** that `[+0x200000, +0x3000000)` (46 MB) is free of every other client (piscsi
  mailbox `+0x2000`, boot ROM `+0x6000`, bounce `+0x80000`, GFXData `+0x3200000`, soft3D
  `+0x4200000`, audio `+0x7CE0000`, ethernet `+0x7E00000..`, USB `+0x7F00000`) in the Amix
  presets; whether the 46 MB bound is the firmware's or only the AmigaOS driver's choice
  (`DRV/rtg/gfx.c:511`); and whether the firmware itself ever writes into that range
  (e.g. its own boot splash / text console).
- **Why:** the row's `fb_phys` and `fb_max`, hence `board_size` and what `Xzz9000` mmaps.
- **Where:** `FW/Z3660/src/memorymap.h`, `rtg.c` (`video_state->framebuffer`), `video.c:143`.
- **We assume:** free; the bound is the AmigaOS driver's, safe to reuse.
- **Answer:** **CLOSED.** Firmware maps `[+0x200000, +0x8000000)` (`init_rtg_bank`, `uae_emulator.cpp:1023`);
  `[+0x200000, +0x3000000)` is clear of every client — boot ROM `+0x6000`, bounce `+0x80000` and the
  piscsi mailbox are below it in the register window; the first client above is GFXData at
  `+0x3200000` (`memorymap.h:21`), then soft3D `+0x4200000`, USB `+0x7F00000`. The audio/ethernet
  constants in `memorymap.h:28-34` are spelled as absolute low-DDR addresses on the ARM side; from
  the guest the net driver binds them as board-relative offsets in the top 32 MB of the window
  (`amix-z3660net/src/z3660eth.h:36-45`; ARM MMU reserves RTG-relative MB `0x60-0x80` for
  overlay/audio/mpeg/eth, `cpu_emulator.cpp:432-459`) — above the 46 MB bound either way. The 46 MB
  bound is the AmigaOS driver's, not the firmware's; safe to reuse. The firmware writes into the FB
  only for its own boot screen before the guest sets a mode (Q6).

## Q5 — Modes the demo monitor accepts

- **Need:** which mode ids the firmware outputs over HDMI at 60 Hz on the demo monitor
  (5 = 1920x1080, 17 = 1280x800, 18 = 1920x1200, 19 = 1600x900, 20 = 1680x1050, 21 =
  1366x768), and the preferred console mode.
- **Why:** the Z3660 row's `con_w/con_h` (default 1920x1080, a project decision) and the
  X server's mode list.
- **Where:** `FW/Z3660/src/rtg/zz_video_modes.h`, `video.c:100-140` (timing rows); on metal:
  whatever the Z3660's own AmigaOS/Picasso96 setup already shows on that monitor.
- **We assume:** 1920x1080 works.
- **Answer:** **CLOSED for the firmware side; monitor lock is METAL (= A6).** All listed ids are 60 Hz HDMI
  timings: 5 = 1920x1080 (`zz_video_modes.h:9`, `video.c:108`), 17 = 1280x800 (`:21`, `video.c:120`),
  18 = 1920x1200, 19 = 1600x900, 20 = 1680x1050, 21 = 1366x768 (`video.c:121-124`); each
  `video_mode_init` programs the pixel clock and the SiI9022 transmitter (`video.c:232-233`).
  Default 1920x1080 is sound.

## Q6 — Who owns the HDMI output

- **Need:** what the Z3660's HDMI shows before any RTG mode is set (nothing? the firmware's
  own console/splash? a scan-converted native Amiga screen?); whether that is the display
  the operator watches during the demo; and what happens to it when the driver writes
  `MODE` — is there any way back (the `OP_CAPTUREMODE` handler is a stub, `rtg.c:1905-1908`)?
- **Why:** the meaning of `SETSWITCH CAPTURE` / "noconsole" on metal, and demo safety.
- **Where:** `rtg.c` (`zz_set_monswitch`, video init), `video.c`; on metal: observation only.
- **We assume:** the switch is a no-op; RTG output is the only HDMI content.
- **Answer:** **CLOSED for the firmware side; which panel the operator watches is METAL (= A2).** The
  firmware owns the single HDMI output and drives it itself at boot: the `BOOT_SCREEN` block sets
  `config.bootscreen_resolution` in RGB565 and renders its own splash/console into the framebuffer
  (`video.c:245-270,698`). A guest `MODE` write reprograms the same output (`rtg.c:1111-1132`).
  `OP_CAPTUREMODE 0x30C` is a stub (`rtg.c:1905-1908`); `zz_set_monswitch` is never called;
  `REG_ZZ_MONITOR_SWITCH 0x318` is a preset field, not a live switch; `main.c:1651` calls
  `monitor_switch(1) // RTG` once. **There is no path to a native Amiga screen through the Z3660**,
  so `SETSWITCH CAPTURE`/"noconsole" cannot restore anything — a no-op by construction.

## Q7 — 16-bit register accesses from the real CPU

- **Need:** confirmation that a 16-bit CPU write into the register file is dispatched as the
  aligned 32-bit word containing it (`rtg.c:570-580` + `:1042`), and that a 16-bit read
  returns one lane (`:676-683`) — i.e. that the Z3660 row must use aligned 32-bit accesses
  only, exactly like `amix-z3660scsi`/`amix-z3660net`.
- **Why:** the accessor's `regw`; GETREG/SETREG width.
- **Where:** as cited; on metal: a 16-bit `SETREG` of `X2` followed by a 32-bit read would
  show it (not needed before 2026-09-19).
- **We assume:** yes — 32-bit only.
- **Answer:** **CLOSED.** For `zaddr < 0x1000` the real-CPU write path reads the full longword from the DDR
  staging cell and dispatches the whole register (`rtg.c:583`), no size decode; `write_rtg_register`
  / `read_rtg_register` mask to `zaddr & 0x1FFFFC` (`rtg.c:779,1042`) and log "write unaligned" on
  `zaddr & 3`; a read returns the full 32-bit register and the FPGA hands back the lane asked for.
  The emulated path is the same (`cpu_emulator.cpp:981-985`). **Aligned 32-bit accesses only.**

## Q8 — The `0x1000-0x1FFF` "test area"

- **Need:** that touching `+0x1000..+0x1FFF` is harmless (raw memory + a `printf` per access
  on the ARM UART, `rtg.c:573-577,646-673`) and that nothing else decodes there in any
  preset; whether the printf can be a problem at UART speed if userland pokes it in a loop.
- **Why:** `mmap` of the compacted device space hands page `0x1000` to userland; GETREG/SETREG
  allow it.
- **We assume:** harmless.
- **Answer:** **CLOSED — harmless for correctness, a hot-loop hazard.** `0x1000-0x1FFF` is raw DDR with an
  **unconditional** `printf` per access on the ARM UART (`rtg.c:573-577` write, `:646-673` read),
  not gated by `debug_console`; nothing else decodes there. A userland loop over that page blocks
  the RTG thread on UART writes. **Consequence adopted:** the Z3660 row's device space excludes the
  page (`fb_offset 0x1000`, `reg_size 0x1000`), so neither `mmap` nor GETREG/SETREG can reach it.

## Q9 — CLOSED (adversarial check): the AutoConfig identity under `autoconfig_rtg YES`

Product byte is `0x01`, manufacturer `0x144B`, `er_type` 128 MB Zorro III, on the emulated
path (`cpu_emulator.cpp:338-345`), the FPGA path (`z3660.v:973-996`) and the documented
real-CPU board list (`Z3660/docs/real-cpu-autoconfig-and-ext-rom.md:21,96-102`). Nothing to
answer unless the Z3660 firmware side disagrees.

## Q10 — Cache attributes expected from the 68k side

- **Need:** whether the firmware expects the framebuffer window to be cache-inhibited /
  serialized on the 68k side, or tolerates write-through; and whether the registers need
  serialized (in-order) stores (the siblings use a `nop` sync before read-back).
- **Why:** 060 metal correctness; `DTT0 = 0x003fc060` already cache-inhibits the low 1 GB
  on the port's kernel (`amix-z3660scsi/src/z3660.c:688-709`).
- **Where:** `FW/Z3660_emu/src/main.cpp:943-954`, `cpu_emulator.cpp:398-459` (ARM-side
  policies only).
- **We assume:** CI on the 68k side is required and is what the port's kernel does.
- **Answer:** **CLOSED.** The firmware sets only ARM-side policy: register window `NORM_NONCACHE`,
  framebuffer Write-Through (`defines.h:9,12`; `main.cpp:945-948`; `main.c:1662-1665`). The 68k-side
  attribute is the kernel's: registers must be cache-inhibited/serialized (the `REG1` handshake needs
  fresh, ordered accesses; use aligned 32-bit + a `nop` sync before read-back like the siblings); the
  framebuffer tolerates CI or write-through-with-flush, not write-back. CI on the low 1 GB
  (`DTT0 = 0x003fc060`) is correct and sufficient.

---

## Assumptions we could not verify from source (DESIGN.md §10) — as questions

- **A1** (= Q2c/d) — **CLOSED on metal (2026-09-16)**: 16-bit stores into the framebuffer through
  the kernel's copy loop produced the correct colours on the Z3660 HDMI and read back `f800f800`;
  the 16-bit *register* lane reads (`0000/0103`) stand on the emulator run (skipped in the
  kernel-copy mode).
- **A2** (= Q6) — **CLOSED (2026-09-16)** and seen on metal (the firmware splash
  "Firmware 1.03 BETA 21 … Z3 RTG AUTOCONFIG Disabled" before the first MODE write): the firmware owns the single RTG HDMI
  output; the native Amiga console is the RGB output, which is what the RGB capture sees;
  the RTG HDMI sits behind a hand-flipped HDMI switch. Enabling RTG cannot disturb the RGB
  console; a metal RTG test needs someone at the switch (DESIGN.md §6 step 4).
- **A3** — **CLOSED**: the 256 MB RAM board takes `0x40000000` first, so the combo lands at
  `0x50000000`; without it, `0x40000000` (`main.c:1663-1664,1487`; `docs/amix-firmware-facts.md:147-153`);
  the exact address is the guest's AutoConfig assignment (`cpu_emulator.cpp:549`).
- **A4** — **UNSETTLED from source** (68k/Zorro bus behaviour): an unclaimed Zorro III address on a
  real A3000/A4000 typically bus-errors (no `/SLAVE`), which is why the row stays compile-time
  gated. And because the firmware's own unknown-register path returns `0xFFFFFFFF`
  (`rtg.c:1024-1026`), `0xFFFFFFFF` must never count as "present" — only `FW_VERSION >> 8 == 1`.
- **A5** (= Q4) — **CLOSED**: clear; first client above the bound is GFXData at `+0x3200000`.
- **A6** (= Q5) — **CLOSED on metal (2026-09-16)**: the demo path's monitor/capture locked 1920x1080
  (reported 60 Hz) and 1280x800 (reported 56 Hz by the capture; the firmware says 60 Hz) from
  the Z3660.
- **A7** — port question, not the firmware's; open until the 040/060-port relink question is taken up
  after 2026-09-19.
