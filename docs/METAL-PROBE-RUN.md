# METAL-PROBE-RUN.md — zz9k_memprobe on the A4000D (2026-09-16), run sheet for the Z3660 firmware side

> **Status (2026-09-26).** Run and PASSED on 2026-09-16 (`docs/DEMO-RTG.md`, DESIGN §11.5); kept as the historical run sheet.
>
> **Out-of-repo citations.** Run artefacts (reports, transcripts, frames) are cited by file name. They, sibling repositories and archived images are kept outside this repo and are not needed to build or use the driver.

Ground rules: the card in the machine may be used (it is rewritten
the next day); no firmware flash, no card-file changes, no kernel; clean halt, preset 7 selected
at the end. The Z3660 firmware side operates; the driver side directs and verifies.

**Binary:** `zz9k_memprobe` (kept outside the repo)
(sha256 `f92d016582d58a4e…`; cross-built with the wrapper, explicit `-o`; dynamically linked
against `/usr/lib/libc.so.1`; 68020 code; no floating point). Source: `tools/zz9k_memprobe.c`
(commit dc6565b), a copy beside the binary. Transfer to the box as root (e.g. `/tmp/zz9k_memprobe`,
`chmod 755`). It maps only the register page (4 KiB at `0x10000000`) and an 8 MB framebuffer
slice at `0x10200000` through `/dev/mem` — never the 128 MB window — after raising its own VM
limit; every access is announced before it is made and faults are caught and printed.

**Before the run**, capture on telnet: `uname -a`, `ulimit -a`, `ls -l /dev/mem`; on the ARM
serial the boot's `[Core1] Autoconfig RTG to 0x1000` line (= the `autoconfig_rtg NO` hard map).

**Run 1**, as root, to a file and the screen:
```
/tmp/zz9k_memprobe 30 5 2>&1 | tee /tmp/probe1.txt
```
Expected, in order:
```
SELFTEST ... AGREE                              /dev/mem mapping lands on physical
READ32 FW_VERSION 0x1a0 = 00000103 / PRESENT    the signature; if not present it stops
READ16 ... 0x1a0 = 0000 / 0x1a2 = 0103          A1: lanes of 16-bit reads
WRITE32 ... MODE = 00000105                     1920x1080 565: the HDMI switches mode
longword store/readback MATCH; row N via lseek+read = f800f800; row 0 = 00000000
FRAME 1 NOW: bars 1920x1080 -- holding 30 s     -> HDMI frame 1 during these 30 s
FRAME 2 NOW: blue -- holding 30 s               -> frame 2
FRAME 3 NOW: bars again -- leaving them          -> frame 3 (the final state)
zz9k_memprobe: done
```
A line `PROBE FAULT …` means stop and send the whole file (its last line names the access).
The picture stays on the HDMI afterwards: the Z3660 has no switch back — expected.

**Run 2** (only if run 1 completed) — the 1280x800 mode, 20 s holds, one frame during FRAME 1:
```
/tmp/zz9k_memprobe 20 17 2>&1 | tee /tmp/probe2.txt
```

**Send back:** `probe1.txt` (and `probe2.txt`), the frames at full resolution, the serial log
around the runs (any "write unaligned" or RTG debug lines), the telnet captures above. Then a
clean halt, preset 7 left selected.

**What the run answers:** A1 (16-bit lanes and byte order on the FPGA path — the READ16 pair,
the `f800f800` row readback and the bar colours in the frame), A6 (the monitor takes 1920x1080
and 1280x800 from the Z3660), Q6/A2 (what the HDMI shows before and after), and the whole
"real-060 path" question: hard map present, 32-bit register file, framebuffer at +0x200000,
HDMI output — without a driver or a kernel.
