# BENCH-STEP0.md — regression of the board-table refactor on the ZZ9000 rig

> **Out-of-repo citations.** Run artefacts (reports, transcripts, frames) are cited by file name. They, sibling repositories and archived images are kept outside this repo and are not needed to build or use the driver.

**Result: PASS, 2026-09-16** (kernel 20408; every criterion met, nothing adapted; rig report
`27-report.md`; verified here:
T1 transcript diff = the allowed lines only, T4 values exact, T1/T2 screenshots byte-identical
to the 2026-09-15 lane, `-Wall` sets identical). Kept as the record of what was run.

**For the amix-kerntools build rig.** Bench step 0 of DESIGN.md §6: prove that the refactored
driver (branch `z3660-target`, default rows, no `make=`) behaves exactly like upstream 75e2449
did in the 2026-09-15 lane (kernel 09684). The
driver side never builds the kernel or drives the rig; it verifies this report.

## What to build

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Source | this repo (`amix-z3660rtg`), branch **`z3660-target`**, driver bytes as of **6e0acde** (branch head e192d6b or later; the default build is unchanged by later docs-only commits) |
| Subtree | `overlay/usr/sys/amiga/driver/zz9000` (same layout as upstream: `zz9000.c`, `zz9000.h`, `Makefile`, `mkdev.sh`, `tools/`, `init/`) |
| chardevs record | the existing `chardev zz9000 …/amix-z3660rtg/overlay/usr/sys/amiga/driver/zz9000 49 zz9000init zz9000open,zz9000close,zz9000read,zz9000write,zz9000ioctl,zz9000mmap` with **`cflags_strip=-fno-builtin` kept**, **no `make=`**, `git=6e0acde`, and a **new `sha256=` pin** over the tree (the bytes changed: `zz9000.c`, `zz9000.h`, `Makefile`, `tools/zz9k_test.c`) |
| Console hook | OFF, as before (`console=` absent) |
| Rig config | `configs/amix-z3660-piscsi-rig-zz9000.uae` unchanged: `gfxcard_type=ZZ9000_Z2`, `gfxcard_size=4` |
| Kernel | golden 030 build, same recipe as the 2026-09-15 lane; the clean-build gate must pass (two builds, equal `sum -r`) |

The generated driver rule must read `cd zz9000; $(MAKE)` with nothing appended; the driver's
compile line on the box must show `-D_KERNEL -DSVR40 -DSVR4  -I../../.. -I../../inc` (two
spaces where the empty `$(ZZ9K_TARGET)` expands) and **no `-fno-builtin`** (stripped).

## Host-side oracle (before touching the box, 1 minute)

From the kerntools cross toolchain, compile the driver object as the driver side
did and compare with the upstream object:

```sh
# upstream (main = 75e2449 bytes) and z3660-target, each in a copy laid out as
# /usr/sys/amiga/driver/zz9000 beside the stock console/ and inc/ dirs
m68k-cbm-sysv4-gcc -O -traditional -fno-builtin -Dinline=__inline__ -D_KERNEL -DSVR40 -DSVR4 \
    -I../../.. -I../../inc -c zz9000.c -o /tmp/x.o        # always pass -o (wrapper hazard)
m68k-cbm-sysv4-nm /tmp/x.o | grep ' U '   # must be exactly:
#   autocon bootinfo builtinfont conputc copyin copyout printf uiomove
m68k-cbm-sysv4-nm /tmp/x.o | grep ' T '   # must be exactly the nine zz9000* entry points
```
The driver side's result: identical `U` and `T` sets for upstream and 6e0acde; `-Wall` shows the
same five warnings on both sides (the stock header's "`/*' within comment" from `sys/types.h`,
implicit `printf`/`autocon`, unused `zz9k_blit_fill`/`_copy`).

## On the rig — expected output, line by line

Boot (compare with `19-rig-boot-zz9000-kernel.png`): the two driver lines must be **textually
identical** to 09684's:
```
zz9000: autocon match pc 0x6D6E0003 base 0x200000 size 0x400000
zz9000: Zorro II board at 0x200000 size 0x400000 hw 0x0 fw 0x207
```
(no "outside the identity map", no "did not look like", no "no … at").

`sh mkdev.sh` → `crw-rw-rw- … 49, 0 /dev/zz9000`. Build the tools on the rig from the pushed
sources (`cd tools; make`) — zero diagnostics expected under GNU GCC 1.40.5, as before.

### T1 — `zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 1920x800` (compare with `22-zz9k_test-1920x800.txt`)

Same autocon table (three boards). Then, in this order:
```
zz9000: base 0x200000 board 0x400000 fb 0x10000+0x3d0000 hw 0x0 fw 0x207 mode 800x600 color 1
zz9000: zorro 2 product 0x03                      <- NEW line (tool prints GETINFO identity)
fbinfo: 800x600 depth 16 bpp 2 stride 1600 offset 0x10000 size 0x3d0000
fbinfo: masks r 0xf800 g 0x7e0 b 0x1f a 0x0 shifts 11/5/0/0
Safe ZZ9000 register reads:
  HW_VERSION    @0x0000 = 0x0000
  FW_VERSION    @0x00c0 = 0x0207
  MODE          @0x0002 = 0x....                  <- whatever the card holds before SETMODE
  CONFIG        @0x0004 = 0x0000
  VCAP_MODE     @0x000e = 0x0000

Requesting MODE write = 0x0111 (1920x800 color 1)
MODE readback after SETMODE = 0x0111
Driver mode after SETMODE: mode 17 1920x800 color 1
RTG test pattern active. Press return to restore capture:
```
Screenshot while the pattern is held (nohup + `sleep N |` as in the lane): must equal
`25-rtg-1920x800-16-bars.png` (Germany/Spain bars; pixel-check six rows). After return: native
console restored (`26-native-console-restored.png` equivalent). Note the amiberry pan-pitch bug
still applies: use the same `zzpanfix` workaround as the lane if the screen is black after
SETSWITCH.

Note: the 2026-09-15 transcript printed `mode 1920x800` in the first `zz9000:` line because it
was captured after an earlier SETMODE in the same boot; on a fresh boot it reads `800x600`.
Either is fine — the field is the driver's current mode, not a regression signal.

### T2 — `zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 console` (compare with `27-rtg-console-b.png`)

`ZZ9000 console enabled` on the serial/telnet side; the framebuffer console at **1920x800**
with sunfont glyphs, the colour words, the cursor-movement and clear-to-eol lines, 35+ scrolled
rows and the cursor. Return → `ZZ9000 console disabled`, native console back.

### T3 — `zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 blit 1920x800`

Navy `0x0010` background (the tool's FILLRECT after its FILL 0), red/yellow/green 640x200 rects
at (80,80)/(160,180)/(240,280), the (80,80) region copied to (960,400), restore on return. (CPU paths; exercises FILL/FILLRECT/COPYRECT via
`bp->fb`.)

### T4 — read(2) across the register/framebuffer seam (NEW check, the `zz9k_devphys` path)

While T1 holds the bars (top sixth of 800 rows = rows 0-132 black `0x0000`, rows 133-265 red
`0xf800`, stride 3840):
```sh
dd if=/dev/zz9000 bs=65536 skip=1 count=1 2>/dev/null | od -x | head -2
#   0000000 0000 0000 0000 0000 ...          (framebuffer row 0, black)
dd if=/dev/zz9000 bs=65536 skip=9 count=1 2>/dev/null | od -x | head -2
#   0000000 f800 f800 f800 f800 ...          (offset 0x90000 = fb + 0x80000 = row 136, red)
dd if=/dev/zz9000 bs=4096 skip=15 count=2 2>/dev/null | wc -c
#   8192                                      (0xF000..0x10FFF spans the seam; no error)
dd if=/dev/zz9000 bs=65536 skip=64 count=1 2>/dev/null | wc -c
#   0                                         (EOF at board_size 0x400000, as before)
```

### T5 — GETREG/SETREG bound unchanged

`bench/zzpanfix.c` still works: `zzpanfix /dev/zz9000 1920` → `zzpanfix: X2=1920,
PAN=0 re-issued`, and the bars appear at once (a SETREG at 0x14/0x0a/0x0c on a 16-bit row).

## Pass criterion

All of: boot lines identical; T1 transcript equal to the lane's modulo the one NEW `zorro 2
product 0x03` line and the pre-SETMODE `mode`/MODE fields; T1 bars and T2 console screenshots
match the lane's; T4 values as listed; tools compiled with zero diagnostics on the rig; clean-gate
STABLE. Anything else is a regression: report the exact line and stop (the refactor is meant
to be invisible on this rig).

## Evidence to keep

Under `<date>-zz9000-rig-step0/`: build log (with the driver compile line), clean-gate
sum, boot screenshot, T1/T2/T3 transcripts and screenshots, T4 `od` output, the chardevs record
line used (with its sha pin), `git -C amix-z3660rtg rev-parse z3660-target`.
