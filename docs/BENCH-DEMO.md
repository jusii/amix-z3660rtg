# BENCH-DEMO.md — the no-X demonstration picture, rehearsed on the stand-in

> **Out-of-repo citations.** Run artefacts (reports, transcripts, frames) are cited by file name. They, sibling repositories and archived images are kept outside this repo and are not needed to build or use the driver.

**For the amix-kerntools build rig.** This rehearsal produces the frames that decide whether
RTG is shown in a demo. It is the **first on-box run of the `c1.c` console hook**
(`console=zz9000consolewrite`), so it needs a **fresh kernel**: step-2 record + `console=`,
driver bytes **6137966** (adds `ZZ9KIOC_CONPUTS`, the 060-safe console test, and moves the Z3660 row's device space to the framebuffer alone — `fb_offset 0`, `board_size 0x2E00000`; tools from the same revision: `zz9k_cat`, `zz9k_reg`, `zz9k_demo`, `zz9k_test` raising its own VM limit), `make=ZZ9K_TARGET=-DZZ9K_TARGET_Z3660,ZZ9K_BENCH=-DZZ9K_BENCH_Z3660`,
`cflags_strip=-fno-builtin` kept, new sha pin; rig = the step-2 config (stand-in, `chipset=aga`
+ `chipset_compatible=A3000`). Optionally a second kernel with
`…,ZZ9K_OPTS=-DZZ9K_Z3660_CON_1280x800` to compare console text sizes (only
if time allows; the 1920x1080 frame comes first).

What the demo would show on the Z3660's HDMI (the firmware splash until then):
1. **Live text on the RTG screen, two ways.** (a) `zz9k_cat`: any command's output piped into
   the framebuffer console through the new `ZZ9KIOC_CONPUTS` ioctl (`ls -l / | zz9k_cat`;
   `sh -i 2>&1 | zz9k_cat` gives a shell whose output lands on RTG while input is typed on the
   telnet/serial side) — **this path needs no kernel source hook and is what a relinked 060
   kernel could also do.** (b) the `c1.c` hook: after `zz9k_console start` the displayed VT's
   own output lands on the RTG console (`sp == displayedscreen` gate) — a real login shell on
   the VT, but only in a kernel built from source with the hook (this bench kernel; not the
   060 relink).
2. **The test pictures** — `zz9k_demo` (bars 1920x1080, the fill/copy test, the console test
   page), each held 20 s, with the VM limit raised inside the script.

Evidence dir `<date>-zz9000-rig-demo/`; the report comes back to this repo.

## D1 — boot and the hook's presence

**Boot lines from driver bytes 7e5c0e8 onward (candidate 2):** on a rig where amiberry's
piscsi model AutoConfigures as `0x144B0001` at `0x40000000`, the autocon row matches it first,
is refused, and the fixed row then attaches the stand-in — **three lines, all expected**:
```
zz9000: Z3660 RTG at 0x40000000 size 0x8000000 is outside the identity map
zz9000: set autoconfig_rtg NO for AMIX
zz9000: Z3660 RTG (fixed base) at 0x10000000 size 0x2E00000 hw 0xFFFF fw 0x103
```
(Before 7e5c0e8 it was one line; the first two are the probe correctly declining the
emulator's Zorro III board and moving on. `-DZZ9K_BENCH_Z3660` is no longer needed — accepted
and ignored.)

Boot line (bytes before 7e5c0e8): `zz9000: Z3660 RTG at 0x10000000 size 0x2E00000 hw 0xFFFF fw 0x103` (from 6137966 the
reported window is the framebuffer alone: `fb 0x0+0x2e00000` in `zz9k_test`; the register page is
no longer readable through `read(2)`/`mmap`, only through GETREG).
The kernel build log must show `c1.c` patched (the generator's gate insert) and the link must
resolve `zz9000consolewrite` (nm on the kernel: `T zz9000consolewrite`). Nothing is on the RTG
screen yet except the stand-in's "native" view — the hook is inert until redirect is enabled.

## D2a — text on RTG through `zz9k_cat` (works on any kernel with the driver)

On the telnet console, as root:
```
uname -a | zz9k_cat                  # enables the console redirect itself; text appears on RTG
(date; ls -l /; cat /etc/motd) | zz9k_cat
. /usr/amiga/bin/zz9k_colorls_env; colorls -l /usr/amiga/bin | zz9k_cat   # ANSI colours
sh -i 2>&1 | zz9k_cat                # a shell: type on telnet, output on RTG; `exit` ends it
```
**Frame D2a-1** after the first three; **Frame D2a-2** with the shell showing a couple of
commands. Transcript: the telnet side (which shows only what was typed). Then `zz9k_console
stop` is a no-op for the picture (no switch back) — note it.

## D2b — the VT shell on RTG through the `c1.c` hook (this bench kernel only)

On the telnet/serial console, as root, with the tools built from f5799f9 and installed
(`make install-tools`):
```
zz9k_console start          # -> "ZZ9000 console redirect enabled. Native RGB drawing should stop."
```
From now on the displayed VT's output goes to the RTG screen (the stand-in shows RTG after the
first MODE write). On the **VT itself** (the amiberry window's Amiga keyboard — or, if the rig
is headless, note that telnet output is NOT the VT and will not appear on RTG; use the IPC
keyboard to type on the VT), log in and run:
```
uname -a
date
ls -l /
cat /etc/motd
```
**Frame D2-a** (1920x1080, `SCREENSHOT`): the login banner and these outputs in white-on-black
sunfont text on the RTG output; the cursor visible. **Frame D2-b**: after `/usr/amiga/bin/colorls
-l /usr/amiga/bin` with `. /usr/amiga/bin/zz9k_colorls_env` — colours through the ANSI SGR path.
Transcript: the same commands' output on the VT capture (they must match the frame).
Then `zz9k_console stop` (= `noconsole`) → `zz9000 console disabled`; on the Z3660 row this
does **not** switch the RTG output back (no capture path): the last frame stays. Note it.

If telnet is the only keyboard: `zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 consoletest` after `start` still
proves the path (the kernel prints the test page through the same renderer), and D2 becomes
"kernel-driven text on RTG" — say so in the report; it must be clear whether a live
shell was actually shown.

## D3 — the pictures

```
ulimit -a | grep memory          # record the default (16384)
/usr/amiga/bin/zz9k_demo /dev/zz9000 20 1920x1080
```
**Frames D3-a/b/c**: bars, the fill/copy composition, the console test page, each while held.
The script's own lines (`zz9k_demo: bars 1920x1080 for 20 s` …) and the three `zz9k_test`
transcripts in the evidence. No `mmap:` line (the script raises the limit). Exit 0.

## D4 — what the viewer sees in sequence (dry run of the demo script itself)

`zz9k_console start; zz9k_demo /dev/zz9000 20; zz9k_console start` — the RTG output shows:
shell → bars → fill/copy → console page → shell again (the second `start` re-clears and
re-enables the console). **Frame D4**: the final state. Record the total wall time.

## Pass criterion

D1 boot line and `T zz9000consolewrite`; D2a two frames of piped text/shell output on RTG;
D2b frames showing VT text on RTG (or the explicit "kernel-driven only" statement); D3 three
frames and no mmap error; D4 final frame. The judgement
"is the 1920x1080 console text readable as a demo picture" is made from the frames, which are the
deliverable, at full resolution, plus one downscaled overview if the tooling makes it easy.
