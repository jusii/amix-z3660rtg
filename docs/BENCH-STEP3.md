# BENCH-STEP3.md — Z3660-row robustness on the stand-in (transcript-decidable)

> **Out-of-repo citations.** Run artefacts (reports, transcripts, frames) are cited by file name. They, sibling repositories and archived images are kept outside this repo and are not needed to build or use the driver.

**Result of the first run (2026-09-16, kernel 40217 = c5a5a46, tools f5799f9):** R1, R4, R6, R7
PASS; R3 PASS by frame (its enable/disable strings are kernel-console printfs, not telnet
stdout — recipe corrected); R2's two "allowed large mode" cases could not run (the tool lacked
2560x1440 and 1920x1200 — added in ea4f546); R5 showed a read at `0x2E00000` (inside
`board_size 0x2E01000`) failing and a `dd seek=11793` write "succeeding" — **both measured through
the box's `dd`, whose skip/seek behaviour on a character device is unknown; the driver checks
both directions with the same expression**. R5 is re-specified below on `zz9k_rw` (one lseek + one
read/write, errno printed) and is **open** until run that way on a 6137966-or-later kernel. R6:
the tool's exit status is masked by `| tee`.

**Layout note (6137966 and later):** the Z3660 row's device space is the framebuffer alone
(`fb_offset 0`, `board_size 0x2E00000`); R5's register-page `dd` lines apply only to kernels
built from earlier bytes (40217 = c5a5a46). On later kernels `dd … count=1` reads framebuffer
row 0 and the EOF/ENXIO boundary is `0x2E00000` (skip 11776).

**For the amix-kerntools build rig.** Runs on the step-2 rig config (stand-in, `chipset=aga` +
`chipset_compatible=A3000`, no ZZ9000 line) and the **existing kernel 40217** (driver bytes
c5a5a46; the `zz9000.c` change in f5799f9 only names the console geometry it already had, so
40217 is the same driver). The tools come from **f5799f9** (`zz9k_reg` is new): build them on
the rig from that revision's `tools/` (or re-pin and rebuild the kernel — your call; both are
valid). Every check below is decided from the transcript; screenshots are optional except
where named. Run every mapping test under `ulimit -v 131072`.

Evidence dir `<date>-zz9000-rig-step3/`; the report comes back to this repo.

## R1 — mode switching back and forth (SETMODE path, no reboot)

Sequence, each a separate `zz9k_test` run held ~5 s (`sleep 5 |`):
```
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 1920x1080   # MODE write = 0x0105, mode 5
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 1280x800    # MODE write = 0x0111, mode 17
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 800x600     # MODE write = 0x0101, mode 1
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 1920x1080   # back
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 32 1280x720    # 32-bit: MODE write = 0x0200, mode 0, color 2
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 1920x1080   # back to 565
```
Expected per run: `Driver mode after SETMODE: mode <id> <w>x<h> color <c>`, `RTG test pattern
active`, bars at that geometry (one screenshot each for 1280x800 and 1280x720/32 is enough —
the 32-bit bars use the tool's `draw_bars32` colours). The stand-in's access log shows exactly
one `W 100 = 0000<mode>` per SETMODE and the zeroing writes (`110/114/118/11c/148/140/144/188/120`)
before it. `GETINFO` after each run (the tool prints it) reflects the new geometry.

## R2 — invalid and unsupported modes

```
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 1920x800    # not on the Z3660: ZZ9KIOC_SETMODE: Invalid argument
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 2560x1440   # id 11: 2560*1440*2 = 7.3 MB < fb_size → allowed; bars (tools from ea4f546 know the string)
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 32 1920x1200   # 1920*1200*4 = 9.2 MB: allowed (fb 46 MB); mode 18 color 2
```
The first must fail exactly at SETMODE with EINVAL and leave the previous mode in force
(`GETINFO` via a following `zz9k_test … 16 800x600` run shows the old mode before its own
SETMODE — it prints `mode …` from GETINFO first).

## R3 — console enable/disable cycles

```
sleep 5 | zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 console      # enable + test page + disable
sleep 5 | zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 console      # again: same page, no leftovers from run 1
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 consoletest            # test page on the already-disabled console: must re-enable it (ENXIO otherwise) and print the page
zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 noconsole              # "ZZ9000 console disabled"
sleep 5 | zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 1920x1080 # bars still work after console cycles
```
Console geometry on this build is 1920x1080 (`cols = 1920/8, rows = 1080/16` with sunfont).
The lines `zz9000 console enabled` / `zz9000 console disabled` are kernel `printf`s: they appear
on the kernel console (the VT / the RTG when redirected), **not** on telnet stdout. Decide R3 by
the frame and by the tool's exit status. Screenshot of the second run's page.

## R4 — GETREG/SETREG bounds and lane semantics (`zz9k_reg`, new)

```
zz9k_reg /dev/zz9000 get 0x1a2    # reg 0x01a2 = 0x0103   (FW_VERSION low lane)
zz9k_reg /dev/zz9000 get 0x1a0    # reg 0x01a0 = 0x0000   (high lane)
zz9k_reg /dev/zz9000 get 0x0000   # reg 0x0000 = 0xffff   (unmapped, high lane of 0xffffffff)
zz9k_reg /dev/zz9000 get 0x0ffe   # reg 0x0ffe = 0xffff   (last lane inside reg_size)
zz9k_reg /dev/zz9000 get 0x1000   # ZZ9KIOC_GETREG: Invalid argument   (reg_size bound = the test area is unreachable)
zz9k_reg /dev/zz9000 get 0x1a1    # ZZ9KIOC_GETREG: Invalid argument   (odd offset)
zz9k_reg /dev/zz9000 set 0x118 0x0000 ; zz9k_reg /dev/zz9000 set 0x11a 0x0780
                                  # HI latch then LO write: the access log shows ONE 4-byte write W 118 = 00000780 (X2 = 1920), nothing at 0x11a
zz9k_reg /dev/zz9000 set 0x11a 0x0000
                                  # LO write with an empty latch: W 118 = 00000000
```

## R5 — read/write bounds (re-specified on `zz9k_rw`; for a 6137966-or-later kernel, `board_size 0x2E00000`)

```sh
zz9k_rw /dev/zz9000 read 0 0x1000            # read 0x0 len 0x1000: 4096 bytes … (framebuffer row 0 on this layout)
zz9k_rw /dev/zz9000 read 0x2dff000 0x1000    # 4096 bytes (the last page)
zz9k_rw /dev/zz9000 read 0x2dff000 0x2000    # 4096 bytes (a transfer that would cross the end is CUT to the window)
zz9k_rw /dev/zz9000 read 0x2e00000 0x1000    # errno 6 (ENXIO: at board_size)
zz9k_rw /dev/zz9000 read 0x2e01000 0x1000    # errno 6
zz9k_rw /dev/zz9000 write 0 0x1000 0         # 4096 bytes (row 0 black if a mode is up)
zz9k_rw /dev/zz9000 write 0x2dff000 0x2000 0 # 4096 bytes (cut to the window)
zz9k_rw /dev/zz9000 write 0x2e00000 0x1000 0 # errno 6
zz9k_rw /dev/zz9000 write 0x2e01000 0x1000 0 # errno 6
```
The driver's rule (`zz9000rw`): offset ≥ `board_size` → ENXIO for both directions; a transfer
that would cross the end is shortened to the window. Any other result is a driver finding —
report the exact line.

## R6 — the VM limit path (tool behaviour)

Without `ulimit`: `zz9k_test /dev/zz9000 16 1920x1080` → `mmap: Not enough space`, then the
tool prints the hint (`Cannot map 0x2e01000 bytes … raise the process VM limit first (e.g.
ulimit -v 131072); the default is 16 MB.`), issues `SETSWITCH CAPTURE` (a no-op on this row —
the RTG keeps showing the last frame; that is expected, §3.5 of the stand-in contract) and
exits 1. Then with `ulimit -v 131072` the same command succeeds.

## R7 — repeated probe / open

`for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do zz9k_reg /dev/zz9000 get 0x1a2; done` — five identical lines, no
re-probe messages on the kernel console (the driver keeps `bp->base`), and the stand-in log
shows only the five reads at `0x1a0`.

## Pass criterion

Every listed line as given; no kernel message other than the driver's own console
enable/disable lines; the stand-in log never shows an access below `0x100` or in
`0x1000-0x1FFF`. Anything else is a finding: record the exact line and stop that R-case
(the others are independent).
